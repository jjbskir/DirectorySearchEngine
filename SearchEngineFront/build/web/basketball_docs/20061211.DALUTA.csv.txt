SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As much as he wanted to treat it like any
other victory, Jerry Sloan had to suffer through a little adulation
after the  Utah Jazz  gave him his 1,000th win as an NBA coach. Jazz fans saluted Sloan with a chant of "Jer-ry! Jer-ry!" for
the final two minutes, then a standing ovation at the end of Utah's
101-79 win over the  Dallas Mavericks  on Monday. "That's better than hearing them boo me. I've had a few of
those over the years," Sloan said. "The most important thing is
they were having fun because our team was playing well and I think
they enjoyed that." After the buzzer, Sloan quietly shook hands with his players and
assistant coaches, then started toward the locker room as if it
were any other victory. He had to stop for a few moments as Dallas
coach  Avery Johnson  walked all the way down the floor for one more
handshake. "He's been doing it for a long time and I went over to
congratulate him. He deserves it," said Johnson, who has 90 wins
in his short coaching career. "He's been one of the most
consistent coaches in the history of our game." Carlos Boozer  led Utah with 31 points and 11 rebounds. He said
after the game the Jazz players all signed the ball, then presented
it to Sloan -- whether he wanted it or not. "That's how Coach is. Coach is one of those guys that's the
same guy every day. He's not going to celebrate a big win," Boozer
said. "That's not who he is. He has bigger goals in mind." Sloan is the fifth coach to win 1,000 games. It was much more
important to him that the Jazz (16-5) kept the NBA's best record
and beat the defending Western Conference champion Mavericks. "I'm glad it's behind us and now we can play basketball," said
Sloan, who is 1,000-663 as a coach. Deron Williams  finished with 15 points and seven assists for
Utah and  Andrei Kirilenko  had four blocks and six assists to go
with his 10 points.  Matt Harpring  added 15 points and eight
rebounds. Dirk Nowitzki  led Dallas with 26 points and 11 rebounds. No one
else approached double figures on the boards for the Mavericks, who
were outrebounded 42-26. "They really got the best of us at both ends of the floor,"
Nowitzki said. "In the third and the fourth, we couldn't really
get it down to 10, eight, to make it a ballgame. You've got to give
them the credit." Dallas has lost three of five since its 12-game winning streak. The Mavericks had won seven of their last eight game against the
Jazz, but never held a lead in their first meeting this season. Dallas shot 26-for-69 from the field.  Anthony Johnson  was the
only Maverick other than Nowitzki to score in double figures with
10 points. The Mavericks made a brief push by hitting their first four
shots of the third quarter, cutting Utah's 51-39 lead to 55-47 on a
shot in the lane by  Josh Howard . Dallas got within 65-54 on a 3-pointer by Johnson as the shot
clock expired, but the Jazz answered with a 10-2 run. Kirilenko
drove around  Devean George  for a layup, then dunked over DeSagana
Diop off an inbounds pass to put the Jazz ahead 69-54. Utah led 75-63 at the end of the third quarter and Williams
opened the fourth with a 3-pointer to start a 13-2 run for the
Jazz. Boozer converted a three-point play that put Utah up 85-65, then
hit an 18-foot jumper to make the lead 22 with 8:07 left. Mehmet
Okur added a free throw before  Maurice Ager  hit Dallas' second
field goal of the quarter. Only 6:19 remained and the Mavs had
already pulled their starters. Nowitzki and the other four starters were on the bench at the
end to hear Utah fans celebrate Sloan's milestone. "That's awesome," Nowitzki said, shaking his head. "I'm not
really happy that we got to be a part of it, but he meant so much
to this league. He always gets the best out of his players." Game notes The Jazz had 24 assists to eight for Dallas. ... George and
Avery Johnson received technicals at the end of the third for
complaining after Utah kept possession when the ball was knocked
out of bounds. Kirilenko made both free throws to put Utah ahead
75-59. ... Fisher and Nowitzki received technicals after colliding
in the first half. Utah assistant Phil Johnson got a technical a
few seconds later.
