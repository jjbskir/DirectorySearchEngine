PHOENIX (AP) -- When the 3-pointers start falling for Phoenix, it's bad news for the opposition. Leandro Barbosa  scored 30 points and  Raja Bell  added 24, including a season-high seven 3-pointers, to help the  Phoenix Suns  stay unbeaten against Charlotte with a 118-104 victory over the Bobcats. Barbosa hit five 3-pointers as the Suns improved to 8-0 against Charlotte since the Bobcats' franchise was established in 2004.  Amare Stoudemire  added 24 points and  Shawn Marion  14. Overall, Phoenix made 16-of-36 3-pointers. "Those guys can shoot, man," said Charlotte's  Raymond Felton . "Barbosa and Raja, those guys were putting that thing up in the air." Jason Richardson  scored 25 for the Bobcats, who lost the last four on a five-game road trip. Felton scored 19 and  Emeka Okafor  had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte. The Bobcats were without leading scorer  Gerald Wallace  for the second game in a row because of a right foot sprain. The Suns led 54-51 at the half thanks to Marion's 30-foot bank shot at the buzzer, then never trailed again. Bell sparked a 33-point third quarter, hitting four 3-pointers. "We weren't real sharp," Phoenix's  Steve Nash  said. "We missed a bunch of shots and never had that killer instinct to take them out of their zone. Eventually we did, but it took us longer than we would have liked." Phoenix made 22-of-35 shots (63 percent) in a 64-point second half. Charlotte coach Sam Vincent said the zone defense worked for a half. "But Phoenix is a good team. They figure out how to win games," he said. "They figured our zone out and they started making shots." Bell's seven 3s -- in 12 attempts overall -- were one shy of his career best. He was 7-for-9 from behind the arc after missing his first attempts. "I felt good, it just wouldn't go in," Bell said, "but it was pretty obvious that they were going to be in their zone and I was going to get the opportunity to shoot a lot more. You just shoot. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't but you try to stay confident and keep shooting the ball." The Suns, winners of eight of their last 10 but coming off an 84-81 home loss to San Antonio last Thursday, struggled through the first half. "We were sleeping out there a little bit," Phoenix coach Mike D'Antoni said. "It was not bad. It was just one of those games. We got it over with, and we have a great game coming up Wednesday." Phoenix, 2-1 halfway through a season-long six-game home stand, play New Orleans on Wednesday. The Hornets are 2-0 against the Suns this season. Charlotte was up 46-41 after Felton's two free throws 3:54 before the break, but a 10-2 run gave Phoenix a 51-48 lead. Bell sank 3s two during the spurt. Nazr Mohammed 's three-point play on a rebound basket tied it at 51 with 32.1 seconds left in the half. The Suns made 6-of-11 3s to take control in the third quarter. Bell was fouled by  Jared Dudley  on a 3-point attempt and made the free throws to give Phoenix a 63-54 lead with 9:26 to go in the third. The lead reached 87-72 on Bell's 3-pointer with 23.2 seconds left in the third. Barbosa led the Suns with 19 first-half points in 11 minutes on 7-for-10 shooting. But overall Phoenix shot just 44 percent in the half compared with 53 percent for the Bobcats. Game notes  The Suns are one of two teams that Charlotte has not beaten. The other is Dallas. ...
