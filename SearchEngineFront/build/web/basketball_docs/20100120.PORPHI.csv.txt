PHILADELPHIA -- Former 76ers guard  Andre Miller  and  Jerryd Bayless  softened the loss of  Brandon Roy . With the two-time All-Star sidelined for the second half with a strained right hamstring, the duo scored all but 10 of its combined 42 points in the second half, leading the  Portland Trail Blazers  to a 98-90 victory over Philadelphia on Wednesday night. Miller had 24 points and Bayless added 14 of his 18 in the fourth quarter. "Miller gets us into our offense and gets the ball where it needs to go," Portland coach  Nate McMillan  said. "Jerryd is the guy that is attacking and creating shots. He was the difference in this game going down the stretch, making big plays and big shots." LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 23 points for the Trail Blazers. Sixers center  Samuel Dalembert  arrived at the Wachovia Center at 6:57 p.m. and started. He had been on a two-day, goodwill mission to his native Haiti, which is recovering from a devastating earthquake. He had 15 rebounds and 10 points, his sixth double-double in his past eight games. Most of his energy came in the second half. "He's a great person. He's doing a lot for his country and a lot for his teammates," teammate  Allen Iverson  said. "He's got a lot on his shoulders, but he's carrying the load." Averaging 23.4 points, Roy left after scoring 10. He grabbed his right thigh after banking in a 10-footer with 1:02 left in the second quarter and is listed as day-to-day. "This was a sad game for Brandon," McMillan said. "The other guys stepped up and played well. What we have to do is keep our heads up and let each other play the game." The Blazers overcame his loss thanks in large part to Miller, who signed with Portland in the offseason. Portland led 90-83 with 3:12 to go, but the Sixers scored six straight points, and an steal and layup by  Andre Iguodala  cut it to 90-88 with 1:38 to go. Iguodala led the Sixers with 23 points, and  Elton Brand  had 13. Miller then made two free throws, and after Brand hit an 8-footer with 59 seconds left, Bayless and Aldridge each made two foul shots apiece to clinch the victory. The Blazers made 22 free throws, one more than the Sixers attempted. Opponents have made more than Sixers attempts in three of the past four games. "We are a little snake-bitten right now," Iverson said. "We are having a lot of bad things [happen] towards the end of games. A stop here or there and we would be right there. We can't seem to get over the hump." The Trail Blazers did. "It was a big win," Miller said. "They came to Portland and beat us, so at least we got the win here. We made plays and got to the free throw line and got it done." Game notes  Dalembert's humanitarian visit is in association with Project Medishare www.projectmedishare.org. ...
