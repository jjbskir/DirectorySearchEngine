 The final score was relatively lopsided, but the game wasn't. There were 10 lead changes and 21 ties, the last one with 4:44 left. The Cavs closed the game by outscoring Detroit 19-7, thanks in large part to James. He set up  Mo Williams  for a tiebreaking 3-pointer with a sharp pass from the top of the key to the right corner, then grabbed a rebound, charged up the court and made a drop pass to  Anderson Varejao  for a five-point cushion. The Pistons wouldn't go away, pulling within three points three times, before James blocked a shot and made consecutive jumpers to seal the win. "The guy's not human," said Detroit's  Will Bynum , adding he thought James got away with goaltending on his layup with 1 1/2 minutes left. "When he gets rolling, you just want to try to stop his teammates and hope that's enough." Those teammates led the way when the superstar had as many turnovers (three) as points late in the first quarter and just five points at halftime. Williams finished with 20 points,  Antawn Jamison  had 15 points and 10 rebounds, and reserve  Jawad Williams  added 10 points. James missed 10-of-15 shots over the first three quarters and was 5 for 7 in the final one as he added four assists and three rebounds to his total for his 28th career triple-double. "In the fourth quarter, we made our mark," he said. "That's closeout time for me." He said triple-doubles are "absolutely" his favorite accomplishment other than winning. "That means you're doing everything your team needs to win basketball games," James said. "That is one of the best things you can have as an individual." Adding to his highlight reel, James had a three-point play that ended with a layup after  Tayshaun Prince 's foul just inside the 3-point line. "I'm not surprised by any call in the NBA any more, but you also have to give him some credit," Bynum said. "There's probably no one else on Earth who could have even gotten a shot off like that." Cleveland has won four in a row and lost only one of its last 11 games, improving to an NBA-best 53-15. Richard Hamilton  had 24 points and was one of six Pistons who scored in double figures. Detroit has dropped lost three straight and 10 of 12. The Pistons, unlike recent games, were very competitive until James took over in the fourth quarter. "We were trying to redeem ourselves, so this is very frustrating," said  Charlie Villanueva , who scored 16 points. "It's encouraging to see us compete like this, but it is still another loss." Prince had 15 points and matched a season high with eight assists, Bynum had 12 points, rookie  Jonas Jerebko  scored 10 points and  Jason Maxiell  had 10 points and 15 rebounds. The score was tied after the first quarter, the Pistons led by two at halftime and by one entering the final period. "We know we can play with any team in the league, and tonight proved that again," Bynum said. "We just have to play like this and finish the games."
