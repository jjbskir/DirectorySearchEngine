ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The  Orlando Magic  felt like they had something to prove after a one-point home loss earlier this week. They responded with one of their best outings of the season Friday night. Rashard Lewis  scored 18 points and Orlando led by as many as 34 in a 113-95 win over the  Philadelphia 76ers . Eight Magic players scored in double figures, and  Dwight Howard  had 13 points and 12 rebounds in just 23 minutes. Orlando was a blistering 14-of-23 from 3-point range for the game, compared with 4-for-13 for Philadelphia. 
"We definitely wanted to send a message, especially redeem ourselves after last time in Philadelphia," said  Jameer Nelson , who had 12 points and seven assists. It wasn't just the Feb. 27 Philly loss, though. It was also an 87-86 disappointment Wednesday against the division rival  Washington Wizards . "I thought they would be a little bit stronger and a little bit tougher because they knew they had a game they probably should have won the other night," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. "They thought they let one get away and they probably came out with a little bit more muscle tonight." Louis Williams  scored 18 for Philadelphia,  Andre Iguodala  added 14 points and reserve  Rodney Carney  had 11 points. The 76ers, who at 34-35 are still trying to clinch an Eastern Conference playoff spot, had won four in a row and 10 of 12. The Magic, the NBA leader in 3-pointers made, hurt Philadelphia from long range. Orlando had more 3s in the first 6 1/2 minutes (4) than the Sixers usually have for a whole game. Orlando started 6-for-6 from behind the arc, with contributions from five different players, to help build a 30-11 lead. That was with more than 3 minutes left in the first quarter. 
"It's obviously a huge part of the way we play, and a big weapon," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "It opens things up." The Magic went scoreless for a 4 -minute stretch from the first quarter into the second, and that was the game's only drama. Williams had eight points in a 12-0 Philadelphia run, and the Magic were 0-8 from the field with four turnovers. Still, they were ahead 33-23. "I think every team in the league is trying to figure out how to play them," Philadelphia guard  Andre Miller  said of the inside-out combination with Howard. "It's kind of tough because you have to give them their respect, and their wing players can all shoot the ball." Hedo Turkoglu  had 16 points and nine assists and  Keyon Dooling  scored 13 for the Magic. Nelson had 12 points and seven assists and  Maurice Evans  scored 12,  Keith Bogans  added 11 points and  Brian Cook  scored 10. Game notes  Turkoglu was cheered by a 300-member delegation from his home country of Turkey. They were in town for the annual meeting of a Turkish manufacturing company, which was planned here partly to watch him play. ... Philadelphia picked up four fouls on one Magic possession in the second quarter -- three on C  Samuel Dalembert . ... Both teams play Saturday: the 76ers at New Jersey, Orlando at Atlanta.
