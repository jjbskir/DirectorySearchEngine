PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns went from snowed in to snowed
under by Gilbert Arenas -- and their franchise-best 15-game winning
streak is history. 	   Arenas capped a 54-point night by banking in a 3-pointer from
the top of the key with 30.7 seconds left in overtime and the
Wizards beat the Suns 144-139 on Friday night.

 The Wizards are becoming the streak busters of the NBA. Friday night, Washington became one of only four teams in NBA history ending two winning runs of 12 or more games in the same season:

    	   He didn't call bank, he said, but wasn't surprised it went in. 	   "The way I was going," Arenas said, "I knew it was good." 	   The Wizards have snapped the two longest winning streaks in the
league this season, earlier ending Dallas' 11-game string with a
victory in Washington. 	   "That just goes to show you how talented we are," the Wizards'
Caron Butler said. 	   Arenas' output was the second-most points ever scored against
Phoenix. Only Wilt Chamberlain scored more, 66 for the Lakers in
February 1969 in the Suns' first season. 	   "He wants to win," Washington coach Eddie Jordan said. "He
wants to show he's going to be one of the greatest of all time." 	   Steve Nash matched his career high with 42 points and had 12
assists, and Shawn Marion added 28 points and 13 rebounds for the
Suns, who rallied from 15 points down in the second half to send
the game into overtime. 	   But Butler scored 10 of his 34 -- one shy of his career best -- in
the extra session to help Washington to its eighth victory in 10
games. 	   The Suns arrived a little over two hours before tipoff after
being snowed in for two nights in Denver, and couldn't quite
overcome an offensive onslaught by Arenas that brought an end to
the NBA's longest winning streak in seven seasons. 
 Elias Says Gilbert Arenas scored 54 points Friday after scoring 60 on Sunday against the Lakers. Over the past 30 years, only five other players have scored 50 points twice in a six-day span: Kobe Bryant (2006), Allen Iverson (2004), Antawn Jamison (2000), Michael Jordan (three times in four days in 1987 and then in 1992) and Bernard King (1984).

a plane and come straight to the arena not smelling our best and
not in our pressed linens," Nash said. "But that's the hand we
were dealt. Maybe that did us in a bit tonight." 	   Arenas started the Wizards' four-game western trip with a
career-high 60 points against the Lakers and wrapped it up with his
second-best career output. 	   He converted a three-point play after he was fouled on a running
one-handed 9-foot bank shot to tie it at 127 with 20.9 seconds to
play in regulation. Nash missed a 3-pointer, then Marion and Amare
Stoudemire missed rebound attempts and the game went into overtime. 	   "We had our chances," Suns coach Mike D'Antoni said, "and
didn't get it done in regulation. You have to give Gilbert Arenas
credit. He made some big shots." 	   Arenas, admittedly carrying a grudge after being cut from the
U.S. team for this year's world championships, pounded his chest
and appeared to stare into the stands at Jerry Colangelo several
times after making big plays. Colangelo, the Suns' chairman and
ex-owner, is the head of USA Basketball. 	   He also stared down D'Antoni after sinking a 37-footer at the
first-quarter buzzer. But Arenas said he was not upset with
D'Antoni and insisted he didn't even know Colangelo was in the
building. 	   "When you're on fire, you're on fire," Arenas said of his
showmanship. "We've shown the world that we can compete with these
good teams out here." 	   In a game that resembled the Suns' 161-157 double-overtime
thriller at New Jersey on Dec. 7, Arenas was 21-of-37 from the
field, 6-of-12 on 3-pointers. 	   The sixth of Nash's seven 3-pointers -- in 15 attempts -- tied it
at 134 with 1:20 left in overtime, but Butler scored inside to put
Phoenix ahead 136-134 1:04 from the finish. 	   Phoenix took a 131-128 lead early on the overtime on
Stoudemire's inside basket, but he missed the free throw for what
would have been a three-point play, then Arenas sank a 22-footer to
cut it to 131-130. Butler's eight-footer put Washington up 139-134
with 30.7 seconds to go. 	   The lead changed hands 10 times in a torrid 4-minute span in the
fourth quarter before Marion's 12-footer put Phoenix ahead 119-117
with 2:14 to play. After Stoudemire blocked Butler's shot, Nash
made two free throws to boost it 121-117 with 1:59 left. 	   Jarvis Hayes sank a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 123-122 with
1:04 left, then Stoudemire's reverse stuff made it 125-122. Arenas
made two free throws to cut it to 125-124 with 36.6 seconds to
play. 	   Nash sank two more free throws to boost the lead to 127-124 with
23.9 seconds left. 	   The Suns had to take a three-hour bus ride to Colorado Springs
to meet their charter flight back home on Friday. They arrived at
U.S. Airways Center at 6:15 p.m., 2 hours and 15 minutes before
tipoff. Notes: Phoenix is 33-4 at home against Eastern Conference teams
since Nash joined the Suns in 2004, and two of the losses have been
to Washington. ... The Wizards topped 100 points for the 10th
consecutive game. ... Arenas was 6-for-11 shooting in the first
quarter, 4-of-6 on 3-pointers. ... Jumaine Jones, who hadn't played
in the last five games for Phoenix, saw action in the second
quarter. ... D'Antoni and Nash each drew technical fouls.
