HOUSTON (AP) -- As long as his back holds up,  Tracy McGrady  says
he's ready to carry the  Houston Rockets  until  Yao Ming  returns from
a leg injury. McGrady scored a season-high 38 points and had nine rebounds to
help the Rockets beat Memphis 111-109 on Sunday night, handing
Grizzlies interim coach Tony Barone his first loss. Juwan Howard  added a season-high 22 points, and  Luther Head  had
18 in the Rockets' third straight victory. They are 3-1 since Yao
broke a bone under his right knee. He's out at least six weeks. Coming off another bout with back spasms, McGrady has topped 30
points in the Rockets' last two games without their All-Star
center. On Sunday, McGrady hit 15 of 30 shots and went 5-for-8 from
3-point range. "I'm playing with a great deal of confidence now," said
McGrady, who sat out seven games in December with the back injury.
"Not having the big fellow out there, a lot rides on my shoulders
to carry this team. I'm just accepting the challenge." Dikembe Mutombo , Yao's replacement, had 11 rebounds for Houston.
The Rockets hit 14 3-pointers, a season high. Memphis double-teamed McGrady late in the game and he found Head
open for two 3-pointers in the final 2 minutes. Head went 5-for-6 from 3-point range. "When your teammates have enough confidence in you to pass you
the ball, you've got to have confidence in yourself," Head said. Mike Miller  matched a season high with seven 3-pointers and
scored 32 points for Memphis in its 12th loss in 14 games. The
Grizzlies lost five in a row before Barone replaced the fired Mike
Fratello before Saturday's 110-104 win over Toronto. Miller likes his role in his new coach's free-wheeling offense. "He's given me the opportunity to shoot," Miller said, "and I
know, even if I miss, he will keep giving me the ball." Since Yao's injury, the Rockets had held three opponents to a
combined 34 percent shooting. But Houston's defense struggled from
the start with the speedy tempo set by the Grizzlies, who hit 19 of
their first 32 shots. The Rockets stayed with Memphis by starting 6-for-10 from
3-point range. McGrady hit back-to-back 3-pointers midway through
the second quarter to forge a 42-42 tie. McGrady admitted the Rockets weren't ready for the Grizzlies'
wide-open style. "It's kind of scary when you play a team that has a new
coach," he said. "You don't know what to expect." The Grizzlies led 59-58 at the break after shooting 59 percent
(23-of-39). They scored many of their points by simply racing down
the floor and finding open shots before the Rockets settled into
their defense. "We got away with not being ready to defend," said Houston
coach Jeff Van Gundy. The Rockets mounted an 8-0 run early in the third quarter as the
Grizzlies cooled off, missing seven of their first 10 shots after
halftime. Former Rocket  Stromile Swift  ended Houston's spurt with a
dunk, but McGrady answered with a three-point play that put the
Rockets up 75-68. McGrady added two turnaround jumpers to reach 31 points,
matching his total Friday night in a 94-68 victory over Atlanta. The Grizzlies missed seven straight shots before  Chucky Atkins '
jumper with 2:15 left in the third quarter. Head then made a
3-pointer to stretch Houston's lead to 84-72. Pau Gasol  started a 13-3 Memphis spurt with a three-point play
with 10:17 left in the game. McGrady returned from a short rest
with 8:50 remaining, then crashed into the scorer's table on a
loose ball. The play ended with  Dahntay Jones  dunking at the other
end and cutting the Rockets' lead to 87-85. McGrady set a season high with another 3-pointer 30 seconds
later. Swift scored twice and Atkins scored on a drive with 4:39 left
to put Memphis up 93-92. Houston then went on a 12-2 spurt, capped by a mid-range jumper
by McGrady and a 3-pointer by Head. The Grizzlies answered with a
last-ditch 11-4 spurt and cut the lead to two in the final minute.
Alston sank a free throw with 5.4 seconds to go. Atkins then hit a free throw with 3.6 seconds left, but missed
the second and McGrady rebounded. "I love the way we are playing," Atkins said. "It's fun and
the guys like it. We got a little tired at the end, but we will be
all right." Game notes Rookie  Rudy Gay  twisted his left ankle trying to guard
McGrady late in the third quarter and limped to the bench. He
returned with 5:51 left, then returned to the bench about a minute
later. ... The Rockets have won 19 of the last 24 meetings with the
Grizzlies in Houston.
