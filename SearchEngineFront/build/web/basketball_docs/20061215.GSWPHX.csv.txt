PHOENIX (AP) -- The Suns are still streaking, thanks largely to
the multiple talents of  Boris Diaw . The Frenchman had his fifth career triple-double to help Phoenix
run its winning streak to 13 games -- one shy of the club record --
with a 105-101 victory over the  Golden State Warriors  on Friday
night. Elias Says Phoenix has won 13 straight games after starting the season with a record of 3-6. The Suns are only the third team in NBA history with a winning streak that long that started with the team three games (or more) under .500. The 1993-94 Hawks were 1-4 when they went on a 14-game winning streak and the 1978-79 Lakers were 1-4 when they started a 14-game winning streak.

trip. They led by 25 early in the second quarter, but blew most of
it by halftime and trailed by as many as eight in the third
quarter. "It doesn't mean a lot," Diaw said of his 21 points, 14
rebounds and 10 assists. "The win is the most important thing, and
I got some lucky rebounds. Sometimes the ball is falling in your
hands, and sometimes your teammates make big shots." It was his first triple-double after four in his breakout season
a year ago.  Amare Stoudemire  had 25 points, including a three-point
play that put Phoenix ahead for good, 97-95 with 3:46 to play. Steve Nash  scored 16 points and had just five assists for
Phoenix, the last a bullet pass to  Shawn Marion  for a game-sealing
dunk with 7.8 seconds to go. "That's  Phoenix Suns  basketball, man," Marion said. Monta Ellis  scored 24 points,  Baron Davis  19 and  Mickael Pietrus 
18 for the Warriors. The Suns go to Sacramento on Saturday night to
try to match their club-record 14-game winning streak set in
December 1992. No. 13 was shaky, though. "We didn't play well tonight," Nash said. "We didn't shoot
the ball particularly well against the zone and we weren't really
smooth. After a long road trip that sometimes happens, so we'll see
if we can get it out of our system tomorrow." Davis' 3-pointer put the Warriors ahead 95-94 with 3:59 to play.
Stoudemire muscled inside for the basket and was fouled for the
go-ahead three-point play. Then Marion's 12-footer, on Diaw's 10th assist, boosted the lead
to 99-95 with 2:42 to go. Diaw's two free throws made it 103-96 1:25 from the finish, but
Golden State scored five in a row to cut it to 103-101 on a dunk by
 Andris Biedrins  with 14.2 remaining. Nash brought the ball downcourt, and instead of running out the
clock and waiting to be fouled, threw a sharp pass from midcourt
just above the rim, where Marion grabbed it for a game-clinching
dunk. Nash said he was going to wait to be fouled but worried about
getting trapped. "Rather than wait for the unknown," Nash said, "I just threw
it." Mike Dunleavy 's 3-pointer punctuated a 7-0 spurt that gave
Golden State an 80-72 lead with 3:11 left in the third. The Suns, though, scored the final 10 points of the quarter,
going up 82-80 when  Raja Bell  made a 19-foot runner at the buzzer.
Bell drew an offensive foul from Dunleavy to give Phoenix the ball
for its final third-quarter shot. "It looked like it was over early, but this one we got back in
it and just kept trying to hustle," Golden State coach Don Nelson
said. "We had a shot at it, to be quite honest with you. We just
needed to make some shots, but we didn't. We went cold at the wrong
time." Still, it was an encouraging effort for a Warriors team at the
start of a six-game road trip. "Hopefully we can learn from this and take this with us on the
road," Davis said, "and understand if we can just play with
energy and passion that down the stretch it's anybody's ball
game." Golden State missed its first 13 shots and the Suns took a 16-2
lead on Diaw's layup with 6:17 left in the first quarter. The Suns, who shot 61 percent in the first quarter but 43
percent for the game, got 15-footers from Marion and  Kurt Thomas  to
go up 34-17 after one. Stoudemire's three-point play gave Phoenix its biggest lead,
47-22 with 8:28 to go in the half. From there, the Warriors outscored the listless Suns 30-7,
slicing the lead to 54-52 on  Anthony Roberson 's two free throws
with 1:04 to play in the half. Phoenix scored the last five points of the half, a 3-pointer by
Nash and Diaw's tip-in, to lead 59-52 at the break. Game notes Each team took 31 3-point shots -- the Warriors made 12 and
