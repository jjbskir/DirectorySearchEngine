 Nelson scored 23 of his career high-tying 32 points in the second half, and the  Orlando Magic  beat the  Golden State Warriors  109-98 on Monday night for their fourth win in five road games. "I have no idea how many shots it was, I was just shooting," Nelson said. "I tell people all the time if the shot is there I'm going to take it. I missed a ton of easy shots in the first half, and they were good shots. They were shots that were given to me, so I just continued to take them in the second half." Marcin Gortat , starting in place of the injured  Dwight Howard , recorded his second career double-double with career bests of 16 points and 13 rebounds. The Magic improved to 19-6, their best 25-game start since opening the 1994-95 season at 20-5.  Rashard Lewis  added 21 points and  Courtney Lee  had 16. "Winning games on the road is always a positive," Lewis said. "Jameer was knocking down shots so we continued to go to him. He took over on the offensive end. There were a lot of good things since we weren't playing with our number one guy." Andris Biedrins  scored 23 points to lead the Warriors, who have lost 12 of their last 14 games.  Marco Belinelli  added a career-high 19 points and  Jamal Crawford  scored 16. "I thought we tried to do the right thing," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "It was tough to establish a low post game and we struggled to score." Jameer Nelson made nine of his first 11 shots in the second half after missing seven of 11 in the first half. He scored 15 points in the third quarter as Orlando continually pulled away after Golden State tied the game at 53 with 8:48 remaining. "They were doubling [ Hedo Turkoglu ] on the pick-and-rolls and he was making great decisions in passing the ball," Nelson said. "Guys were finding me, and it was just one of those nights where you feel good." Nelson hit four consecutive shots, three of them from long range, to help the Magic regain the advantage for good.  Tony Battie , who had 12 rebounds, tipped in Nelson's only miss of the third quarter. "We had a lot of great performances," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "Marcin was tremendous with double-figure points and rebounds, and he blocked three shots. Obviously Jameer had it rolling in the first half." Gortat held his own against Biedrins, limiting the Warriors' center to nine rebounds. Gortat brought career totals of 30 points and 31 rebounds into Monday's contest. "I'm not going to lie; I was excited to play, to be starting the game," Gortat said. "Competing against Andris for 27 minutes was exciting, too. I had a straight message from coach, which was to take him out of the boards and get as many rebounds as I could." Golden State's  Stephen Jackson , trying to play through a sprained left hand, is 6-of-41 in his last three games. He was 20-of-46 in the three games before the injury. "I'm not going to make this a big deal about my hand," Jackson said. "It happened and I'm going to keep rolling." The Magic led at halftime, 46-40.
