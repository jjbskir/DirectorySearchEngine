 "I wasn't feeling that great and I didn't warm up at all," Harris said after leading the Nets to their fifth win in six games and fourth straight on the road. "But once you get a couple of shots to drop, it seems to open up a bit more." Credit for the win should probably go to New Jersey trainer Tim Walsh, who treated Harris and made sure the former Wisconsin star was ready to go. "I started feeling it late [Friday] night, so I got to [Walsh] this morning," Harris said. "He gave me some good treatment, got some fluids in me early. I took the last bus here, so I was able to rest all day. There was a bit of peer pressure from some of the other guys, but I knew if I could walk, I could pretty much play." It was impossible to tell Harris, sixth in the NBA with 24.4 points per game, was nearly scratched before the game by the way he played in the first quarter. Harris hit five of six shots, scored 11 points, and pushed the Nets to a 26-21 lead after one. "He pushed through it, and that's a credit to him and his toughness," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "We talked before the game about laying it all on the line because we have three days off before our next game [Wednesday night against the  New York Knicks ]." Vince Carter  added 14 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and the Nets hit nine 3-pointers in the second half and shot 42.3 percent (11-for-26) beyond the arc. "That was the difference in the game," said Philadelphia coach Maurice Cheeks, whose team played without leading scorer and rebounder  Elton Brand  for the second straight night. Brand is out with a strained right hamstring, but is expected back when the 76ers face Cleveland on Wednesday night. "They got a couple of open looks and made them, and then we challenged a couple of shots, and they made them, too." While the Nets were doing that, the 76ers struggled from the field in the fourth quarter, missing seven straight shots in a 6-minute span of the fourth quarter.  Andre Iguodala  led Philadelphia with 20 points, and  Andre Miller  added 16, but the 76ers dropped their fourth straight home game. New Jersey shot 58.8 percent (20-for-34) in the first half but only led 47-44 as Philadelphia enjoyed a 14-5 edge from the free-throw line. The 76ers stayed close despite missing their last six shots of the second quarter and first two of the third, a span of 6:41 between baskets. Despite six 3-pointers in the third quarter -- including back-to-back from long range by Harris -- the Nets were still unable to shake the 76ers.  Lou Williams  scored the final five points of the period and Philadelphia was able to cut New Jersey lead to four at 69-65 entering the fourth. Game notes  New Jersey is 7-3 on the road this season.
