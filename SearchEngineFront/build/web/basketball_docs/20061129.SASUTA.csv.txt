SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The  Utah Jazz  kept their losing streak
brief by getting back to what got them off to the best start in the
NBA. The score was close and the shooting wasn't good for either
team, but the Jazz dominated San Antonio in rebounding and beat the
Spurs 83-75 Wednesday.

 The Jazz seemed to corral almost every missed shot -- and there
were plenty of them -- and outrebounded San Antonio 50-34 while
beating the Spurs for the first time since April 2005. "I repeat it every time: We've got to get our boards because
that was they key to tonight's game," said  Andrei Kirilenko , who
had nine rebounds for Utah. "They missed lots of shots. We didn't
let them get the second chances." Carlos Boozer  led the Jazz with 23 points and 16 rebounds and
 Matt Harpring  added 13 points and 12 boards.  Deron Williams 
finished with 15 points and nine assists. After starting the season 12-1, the Jazz were coming off
consecutive losses to Golden State and Orlando, getting
outrebounded in both games. It was the one area they controlled all
night Wednesday and it helped make up for a sluggish start, when
the Spurs pulled ahead by 10 in the second quarter. The Jazz had 16 offensive rebounds to seven for the Spurs. "We got ourselves into a hole tonight and fortunately we were
able to fight back out of it," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. Tim Duncan  had 21 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio, which
lost for the third time in four games and shot 39.7 percent
(29-for-73) from the field. "We're just kind of in a bad stretch right now. Not too much
you can do," Duncan said. "You've just kind of got to take a step
back and that's what practice will do for us." Bruce Bowen  scored 17 and  Tony Parker  had 14 points for the
Spurs. San Antonio had won 22 of its last 24 games against the Jazz.
The Spurs led by 10 in the second quarter and were up 39-37 at
halftime before Utah woke up in the third quarter and won the
showdown of the teams with the top records in the Western
Conference. Duncan had just seven points and four rebounds in the second
half and was covered much of the time by Boozer. Duncan thought
Boozer helped his defense a little with some contact to Duncan's
arm. "He played the right way. He made the plays and they didn't
blow the whistle. So in that respect, he did a great job," Duncan
said. The Jazz were 8-for-16 in third and got a spark from Kirilenko's
three blocks. Kirilenko also stole a pass from Duncan on the
baseline and saved it from going out of bounds by getting it to
Williams, who started a fast break that Boozer finished to put Utah
ahead 57-53. Robert Horry  tied it at 61 on a 3-pointer for the Spurs as the
shot clock expired with 10 minutes left in the game and it stayed
close until the final few minutes. Boozer put Utah ahead 68-67, starting an 11-3 run that put Utah
in control. Harpring followed with a layup and a jumper in the
lane. Williams finished off the run with a spinning, reverse layup,
then a 3-pointer that gave Utah a 78-71 lead with 2:34 left. Beno Udrih  scored 11 to lead the Spurs' reserves, who scored a
combined 20 points. Mehmet Okur  scored 10 for the Jazz. Game notes San Antonio G  Manu Ginobili  missed his third straight game
