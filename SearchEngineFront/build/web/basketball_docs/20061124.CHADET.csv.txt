AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Flip Saunders' recent postgame pep talk to  Carlos Delfino  wasn't complicated. Keep playing with energy, the second-year  Detroit Pistons  coach told his reserve guard, and the playing time will take care of itself. And when given the chance Friday night, Delfino made the most of his opportunity, fueling a fourth-quarter scoring surge in a 104-95 victory over the  Charlotte Bobcats . "He's getting confidence in himself, the guys he's playing with are getting confidence in him and it gives us a lot of flexibility," Saunders said. "When we go small, we're pretty good." Richard Hamilton  scored 26 points for the Pistons, who have won five straight.  Tayshaun Prince  added 21 and  Rasheed Wallace  had 19. Emeka Okafor  had 23 points and  Brevin Knight  16 for the Bobcats, who led 80-76 early in the fourth quarter. But the Pistons scored eight straight points, capped by Delfino's reverse lay-up with 7:04 remaining, to regain the lead for good. The Pistons led 52-49 at halftime. The Bobcats got within 86-85 on  Adam Morrison 's 3-pointer, but  Chauncey Billups ' 3-pointer and Delfino's dunk again provided the Pistons with breathing room. Wallace made a 3-pointer with 2:27 remaining that extended the lead to 98-89. "(Detroit's) a well-balanced basketball team," Charlotte coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. "We made some critical mistakes. We had some shots that weren't the best and we turned the ball over in critical times." The Pistons took advantage, outscoring Charlotte 30-27 in the fourth quarter. Detroit recovered from a sluggish start in which it committed turnovers on three of its first four possessions. "We're still not executing as good as we could. We've got some lapses throughout the game," Billups said. "But our effort is good every single night." And win streak or not, that's all Saunders expects. "We could win 10 in a row and there's always room for improvement," Saunders said. "Winning five (straight) games -- what that does mean -- is that your guys are doing some things and they're executing."
