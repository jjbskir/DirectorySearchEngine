OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --  Monta Ellis  scored a career-high 39 points, hitting four free throws in the final minute, and the  Golden State Warriors  both scored 22 consecutive points and blew a 13-point lead in the nutty fourth quarter of their 121-119 victory over the  New Jersey Nets  on Thursday night. Baron Davis  posted his eighth career triple-double with 25 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, yet the Warriors weren't safe until Ellis hit two go-ahead free throws with a minute left and two more with 15.7 seconds to play.  Al Harrington  scored 19 points as Golden State finally finished off New Jersey, which lost its seventh straight despite  Richard Jefferson 's 34 points and an impressive fourth-quarter rally. Harrington hit three of his four 3-pointers while Golden State scored 22 straight points in less than four minutes early in the period. New Jersey replied with an improbable 18-4 rally in its fourth stop on a tough six-game road trip, taking a 112-111 lead with 2:03 left on  Antoine Wright 's 3-pointer. But Golden State reclaimed the lead on Ellis' free throws with 60 seconds left, and both Wright and  Jason Kidd  missed 3-pointers before Davis' cherry-picking layup with 25 seconds to play. New Jersey cut the final margin on  Bostjan Nachbar 's 3-pointer in the final second. Vince Carter  scored 29 points for the Nets, who are on their longest skid in more than three years.  Josh Boone  had 21 points and 17 rebounds, and the notoriously poor free throw shooter made 6 of 12 during Golden State coach Don Nelson's scheme to foul Boone intentionally on every possession. Boone airballed his first try, but eventually helped to put the Nets up by eight points entering the fourth. The Warriors 22-point run culminated in Harrington's 3-pointer with 7:09 to play. New Jersey, which has lost three straight and six of eight in Oakland, went nearly 5 1/2 minutes between field goals before starting its own lengthy rally, taking a three-point lead with 1:23 left on Boone's basket. In a game full of mercurial performances on both sides, Ellis saved Golden State with his steadiness. The guard went 13-of-18 from the field and 13-of-14 at the free throw line, playing nearly 41 minutes with just one turnover. The Warriors' defense only got worse after a humiliating loss to the  Minnesota Timberwolves  on Monday. Golden State, which won four times on an impressive five-game Midwest road trip last week, barely avoided another discouraging defeat. Davis, who missed a free throw and a layup in the final moments of the Warriors' one-point loss to the NBA's worst team three days earlier, already had his second triple-double of the season with 6 minutes left to play. Golden State led for most of the first 2 1/2 quarters until New Jersey made an 18-7 run during Boone's repeated trips to the line. The Nets entered the fourth quarter with an eight-point lead, but Davis' 3-pointer with 11:03 to play jump-started the Warriors' run. Game notes  Kidd was born in San Francisco and raised in Oakland before attending high school in Alameda and college in Berkeley. ... The  Cleveland Cavaliers  employed the same foul strategy against Boone last month. Boone, hitting just 20 percent of his free throws at the time, went 3-for-8, but hit two big ones down the stretch in New Jersey's win. ... The Warriors set another attendance record with 19,596 fans in Oracle Arena, which has an ever-expanding capacity. The crowd was Golden State's largest since renovating the arena in 1997.
