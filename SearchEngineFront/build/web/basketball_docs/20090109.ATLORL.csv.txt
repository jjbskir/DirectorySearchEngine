 The Magic starters, led by  Hedo Turkoglu 's 21 points, were a combined 24-of-39 from the field, including 10-of-13 from 3-point range. Orlando scored a season-high 41 points in the first quarter, then tied its season highs for points in a half (71) and game. The Magic also tied a season high with 16 3-pointers. Turkoglu hit all five of his attempts from long range and reserve  J.J. Redick  was 4-of-5 from behind the arc while scoring a season-high 15 points.  Dwight Howard  had 16 points and 10 rebounds, and  Jameer Nelson  added 14 points and nine assists. "I don't think anybody is too concerned with our record, we're just trying to play healthy basketball," Nelson said. "We have a good team, but we know we have to get better. We aren't the best team we could be. We can still get better." The win gave the Magic a sweep of their back-to-back series with the Hawks and improved their home record to 16-3 this season. Orlando was just 25-16 mark at home last year. "We're definitely playing better at home this season," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "Last year, we didn't often see the kind of energy we've seen the last month coming out of the gate hard and sustaining it for the whole game." The Hawks starters, by contrast, were only 15-of-48 from the field and only  Joe Johnson  reached double figures with 11.  Acie Law  scored 16 and fellow reserve  Solomon Jones  added 12 points and eight rebounds for Atlanta. "I'm not real happy," Atlanta coach Mike Woodson said. "We just didn't compete tonight and it started with the five guys that started the game. That's unacceptable. We've got to go back and address that. I want these guys to understand that's unacceptable." "They hit us first and we never hit back," Johnson said. "They wanted it more than us." The game was decided early and decisively when the Magic ran off a season-high 41 points in the first quarter tied its season high for a half. The Magic held the Hawks to just 25 percent shooting over the first two quarters (10-of-40) and led 71-33 by halftime.

Redick came off the bench and connected on three straight 3-pointers and two free throws to help push the Magic lead to 41-18 by the end of the first period. Atlanta contributed to its own misery by missing the first six shots of the second period while the Magic ran off 13 straight points to make it 54-18.
