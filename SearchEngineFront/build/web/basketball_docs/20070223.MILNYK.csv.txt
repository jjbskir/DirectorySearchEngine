NEW YORK -- Instead of overtime, the  New York Knicks  got additional time. Channing Frye  made the most of it, sinking two free throws after a video review put 0.8 seconds back on the clock to give the Knicks a 95-93 victory over the  Milwaukee Bucks  on Friday night.

 Frye After a video review put him at the foul line with 0.8 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter,  Channing Frye  made two free throws to give the Knicks a 95-93 win over Milwaukee. The only other NBA player to make a game-winning free throw with less than one second remaining in a game this season was Indiana's  Darrell Armstrong , in a 93-92 win at Detroit on Dec. 29.

 "I honestly felt like I could have got that ball," Frye said. "But for a ref to make that call at the end takes a lot of guts, and I think at the end of games it's good to see that he's doing the right thing." With the game tied,  Stephon Marbury  was short on a jumper as time was running out, but the officials called a loose-ball foul on Bucks center  Andrew Bogut . After reviewing video of the play, the officials found the foul for holding off Frye came with time remaining. "My reason for going over to the replay was to determine that the foul that was blown during the game, to make sure there was time on the clock when the foul occurred," official Ken Mauer said. The Bucks couldn't get a shot off and lost their season-high seventh straight. "Usually whistles aren't blown in loose-ball situations that close," Milwaukee coach Terry Stotts said. "I didn't see the play. I didn't see if he fouled him. I was surprised. I think we're all surprised the whistle blew." The Knicks overcame 23 turnovers and a quiet night from  Eddy Curry , their leading scorer. Marbury and  Jamal Crawford  each scored 22 points for the Knicks, while Curry had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Mo Williams  had 28 points and 10 assists in another good game against the Knicks, and Bogut finished with 19 points. But Milwaukee came up short again in a close game, dropping its 11th straight on the road and losing for the 22nd time in its last 25 overall. "There's a lot of surprises in a basketball game," Bogut said. "That was a pretty big one." Quentin Richardson  scored 14 points for New York, which kept pace with ninth-place New Jersey and gained on idle Miami, which currently holds the eighth and final playoff spot. The 10th-place Knicks visit the Nets on Sunday and host the Heat on Monday. Curry scored a season-high 36 points against Milwaukee here in December, but the Bucks shut him down this time with physical defense from  Brian Skinner  mixed in with an occasional zone. The Knicks hurt themselves with their own sloppiness, giving the Bucks 27 points off miscues. The Knicks also lost forward  David Lee , their top reserve, to a sprained right ankle and a muscle strain in the third quarter. X-rays were negative and he will be re-evaluated Saturday to determine his status for Sunday. "It's tough," Marbury said. "I noticed when he wasn't in the game right away." The Knicks trailed nearly the entire game before Crawford converted a three-point play and Marbury followed with a 3-pointer for an 84-82 lead with 4:24 to play. Crawford snapped a 90-all tie with a 3-pointer from the right side with 29 seconds remaining, but the Bucks needed just 6 seconds before Williams tied it again from behind the arc to set up the strange finish. Williams is averaging better than 30 points in three games against New York this season. Bogut scored 11 points in the first quarter, and the game was tied at 23 after Williams knocked down a jumper with 0.8 seconds left. The Bucks opened a seven-point lead on  Charlie Bell 's 3-pointer with 3.7 seconds remaining in the half, but Marbury answered with a 3 at the buzzer to make it 51-47 at the break. The Knicks had 14 turnovers against 12 assists in the first half. Milwaukee pushed the lead back to seven on a pair of occasions in the third quarter and led 73-68 heading to the fourth. Curry had only three shots, making all of them, at that point. Game notes  Knicks coach Isiah Thomas said he hadn't watched much TV over the last two days and therefore hadn't seen the many replays of a famous NBA moment he was involved in. Larry Bird stole Thomas' inbounds pass and fed a cutting Dennis Johnson for a layup as Boston stunned Detroit in a 1987 playoff game. The highlight has been shown frequently since Johnson's death Thursday. "It was two just great instinctive plays by two guys that were very in tune with each other," Thomas said. ... Bucks F  Charlie Villanueva  was back after missing three games with a sprained ankle, but G  Earl Boykins  was out and is expected to miss Saturday's game against Philadelphia with an injured thumb. ... Knicks G  Steve Francis  missed the game because of the flu. Lee returned after missing a game for the same reason.
