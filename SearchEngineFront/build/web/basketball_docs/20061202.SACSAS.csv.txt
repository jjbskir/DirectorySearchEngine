 But with a nearly 10-point lead both at the half and at the end of the third period, the Spurs faced a difficult fourth quarter when they were outscored by the Kings 27-20. "I'm glad we won the game," said  Tim Duncan . "To give up almost 25 points a quarter and almost 100 in the game is not what we want to do." Tony Parker , who scored 18 of his 20 points in the first half, echoed Duncan's assessment. "It was an ugly win and we'll take it," said Parker, who also had five of his team's 18 turnovers. "But we definitely need to go back (and) do some more practice and try to play better." Bowen hit six 3-pointers as the Spurs went 11-of-22 from behind the arc. Duncan added 18 points and 11 boards. "It's about doing whatever you can to get victories," said a decidedly humble Bowen. "When the ball is moving for us we get guys open shots and that's what we want." Kevin Martin  led the Kings with 30 points and  John Salmons  added a season-high 20. "I couldn't be prouder of the effort they put forth tonight," said Kings coach Eric Musselman. "I feel bad for them, because they played well enough to win against a great team." It wasn't, in fact, enough, but all five of the Kings' starters scored in the double digits, with  Shareef Abdur-Rahim  and  Mike Bibby  each adding 11 and  Kenny Thomas  contributing 10. "The coaching staff was real proud of us the way we came out and fought," said Martin, who went 11-of-12 from the foul line. "We knew they were going to come out and give it all they had because they came in losing three out of the last four." The Kings entered the fourth quarter down 80-71, but were in the middle of what would be a 20-6 run. Sacramento continued whittling down the Spurs lead by keeping them scoreless for the first 3:31 of the fourth while adding eight points of their own to get within one. A pair of 3-pointers, one each from  Robert Horry  and Bowen, plus four free throws from Duncan kept Sacramento at bay until a fast-break dunk by Martin tied the game at 90. The Kings then took the lead off a jump shot from  Brad Miller . Duncan saved a near turnover and passed to Bowen, who got a good look to sink a 3-pointer. Duncan followed with four more points to put the Spurs ahead 97-92. Manu Ginobili  missed his fourth straight game with a bruised back. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich thinks his star guard will be back for their next game. The Kings'  Ron Artest  also was out Saturday with a sore lower back. Michael Finley , who started in Ginobili's place, went just 2-of-8 from the field and had five points.  Eric Williams , who hasn't scored yet this season, added eight off the bench. Leading 53-45 at the half, the Spurs increased their lead to 16 near the midway point of the third off a dunk from Duncan and a 3-pointer from Bowen plus three free throws when he was fouled while shooting another.
