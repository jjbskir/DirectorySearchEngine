ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The  Orlando Magic  may have improved this offseason, though still not enough to beat Detroit yet -- even if the Pistons are without  Richard Hamilton , and even though they played the night before. Chauncey Billups  had 18 points and seven assists Friday night as the Pistons won their second straight without their leading scorer, 116-92. The Magic were looking to avenge eight losses against Detroit last season, the last four of which swept Orlando from its first playoff appearance in four years. "We're not close to that right now," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said of Detroit's championship caliber. "We're not. That's not a negative and that's not trying to lower the expectations. But it's Game 2, and we're not there, especially against teams like this." Early on, the Magic looked capable of pulling it off. They continued a hot shooting streak from Wednesday, getting three 3-pointers in the first six minutes for a 21-15 advantage. But the Pistons took a commanding lead in the second quarter when Orlando went cold and never let go. "Last year doesn't really matter to me," Billups said. "You have to come out and try and beat them every single time. It has nothing to do with us winning eight straight. We just try and play to win every night." Hamilton also missed Thursday's victory over the  Miami Heat  for personal reasons, but again others picked up offensively.  Flip Murray  scored 19 points;  Tayshaun Prince , who had a career-high 34 on Thursday, had 17; and  Rasheed Wallace  had 16 points and seven rebounds. Reserve  Jarvis Hayes  scored eight of his 11 points in the second half, all at key junctures to stunt Magic momentum. "Our bench is going to be a really, really huge thing for us," Billups said. "They are coming in and playing very aggressive. They are hungry -- you could just look and see it. We are still a little shorthanded." Rashard Lewis  scored 21 points for Orlando,  Dwight Howard  had 16 points and 13 rebounds and  Hedo Turkoglu  added 17 points.  Keith Bogans  had 14 points on perfect 4-for-4 shooting from 3-point range. The Magic went two minutes without a bucket in the second period while the Pistons got seven quick points on a jumper by  Arron Afflalo  and a layup and three-point play from  Jason Maxiell . The Pistons shot 12-of-17 in the quarter, and the lead swelled to 64-55 at halftime on Afflalo's free throws and a jumper by Billups. The Magic mounted an 8-0 run in the third quarter but were still down 76-63 when Wallace hit two free throws to interrupt two scoreless minutes for Detroit. Orlando drew to 80-70, but Howard,  Trevor Ariza  and Turkoglu missed five straight free throws after the Magic had shot 13-of-14 from the line. "We couldn't stop anything that they did and we couldn't score on them and we couldn't rebound with them," Van Gundy said. "That's how far we have to go right there to play with the best teams in the East." Game notes  Detroit outrebounded Orlando 42-34 and outshot the Magic 59 percent to 40 percent. ... Pistons coach Flip Saunders was called for a technical with 1:13 left in the third quarter. ... Lewis was fouled twice shooting 3-pointers. He made all six free throws.
