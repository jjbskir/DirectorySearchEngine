BOSTON (AP) -- The  Golden State Warriors  looked as if they were going to blow a large lead for the second time in three nights. This time,  Baron Davis  had an answer. Davis scored 31 points, and  Mickael Pietrus  added 16 to lead the Warriors to a 96-95 victory over the  Boston Celtics  on Wednesday night. Davis was 11-of-16 from the floor and added eight assists to help the Warriors snap an eight-game road losing streak and win for only the second time on the road this season.  Andris Biedrins  had 12 points and nine rebounds. After blowing an eight-point fourth-quarter lead Monday night in a 105-97 loss to New Jersey, the Warriors survived a late Boston push to improve to 1-3 on its season-high six-game trip. Boston outscored Golden State 24-20 in the final quarter, but Davis bailed the Warriors out with nine points, including three key free throws. "You just get tired of losing," said Davis, who turned the ball over eight times while shooting just 10-of-25 for 25 points against the Nets. "I just wanted to try to control the game as much as possible from the point guard standpoint. Knowing that they were making runs, I thought the best thing to do was to get to the line and kind of use that as something for my teammates to feed off of." Paul Pierce  scored 27 points,  Tony Allen  had 17 and  Ryan Gomes  added 14 for the Celtics, whose five-game winning streak came to an end. Pierce had 18 in the first half to keep Boston close, but was held to two in the fourth and failed to get off a potential winning shot in the closing seconds. The Warriors built their large lead by scoring 21 points off 17 Boston turnovers in the first half and using a second-quarter spurt to go up 58-48 at halftime. Golden State never trailed after Davis assisted on a Biedrins layup with 5:04 left in the second quarter to put the Warriors up 45-44. "Just because you show up doesn't mean you're going to win," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. "I thought that's how we played early on, that we were here and things would take care of itself. And I think it was a bad lesson for us, and it was a great win for them." Golden State scored the first four points of the third quarter to extend its lead to 62-48 before Boston climbed back and pulled to 76-71 to start the fourth quarter. Boston then climbed within a point three times, but Davis twice responded with two points and the third time three Golden State defenders collapsed on Pierce to force a jump ball with 0.6 seconds left. "(Pierce) is deadly in those situations," Warriors guard  Jason Richardson  said. "If he gets the ball and it's a one-on-one, he's going to make that shot. As soon as he turned, we were there and we just made sure that Pierce did not get that shot up." Delonte West  scored the first four points of the fourth to make it 76-75, but Davis responded with a pair of free throws and Pietrus followed with a long jumper to start a 9-3 run. Boston later cut it to 94-93 when a West 3-pointer capped a 7-0 run, but Davis hit an off-balance fadeaway from the baseline with 1:06 remaining to up Golden State's lead. "That's their guy, he's an All-Star performer," West said. "I thought we did a good job defending him, but he just kept making shots." Al Jefferson  once again closed the margin to a point at 96-95 with 48.1 seconds, but Boston never got off another shot after Richardson missed a 3-pointer with 23.9 seconds left.
