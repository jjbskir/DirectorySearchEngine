He arrived at the game wearing a T-shirt with president-elect Barack Obama's likeness on it and was asked if he would consider a future in politics, perhaps as the mayor of Akron, his hometown. "Mayor of Akron?" he said. "I'm already mayor of Akron. I've been that for about 10 years now."

Following a wild scramble for a loose ball near mid-court, James drove to the basket and was fouled by Gooden while hitting a layup. He dropped his free throw to complete the three-point play, giving the Cavs a 10-point lead and breathing room. James then hit a short jumper and tipped in his own miss to make it 97-83 with 3:08 left. James rolled his left ankle late in the first when he landed on  Kirk Hinrich 's foot following a dunk. As the Bulls pushed the ball up the floor, James was limping around under Cleveland's basket when  Wally Szczerbiak  made a steal and passed it ahead to his teammate, who scored on a left-handed layup before going out. The Cavaliers closed the first half with a 10-2 spurt, triggered by Ilgauskas' first 3-pointer since Jan. 22, 2005. Cleveland's big man grabbed a pass from James on the right side in front of Cleveland's bench and calmly set his feet before draining the long-range shot.
