DENVER (AP) --  Allen Iverson  snapped out of his shooting funk
thanks to the return of  J.R. Smith , yet a porous Denver defense
kept him from celebrating.

 Allen Iverson scored 33 points but didn't have a rebound in the Nuggets' 92-83 loss to the Spurs. It was the eighth time in his career that Iverson failed to gather a rebound in a game in which he scored at least 30 points. No player has done that as often as Iverson since Tiny Archibald had 10 such games during his career, all from 1972 to 1975.

 Tony Parker  scored 26 points and  Tim Duncan  had 19 to help the
 San Antonio Spurs  stave off the Nuggets 92-83 Wednesday night. "Moral victories don't mean anything to me at this point,"
Iverson said. "I know that is a good team, but with the guys out
there that we had, we had all the opportunity in the world to win
the game, and that is a game that we should have won. We just
couldn't get it done defensively at the end of the game." Iverson, who sank 15-of-25 shots for 33 points, had insisted
since his trade from Philadelphia last month that the Nuggets
needn't worry about where their points will come from but who will
step up and make stops. "I don't think our offense is going to be the problem,"
Iverson said. "If we stop people, then the sky's the limit for us.
I don't think we'll have too many problems if we get stops." It was the Spurs who made all the big defensive plays in this
one. "Our defense got it done," Duncan said. "It was all about desire,"  Bruce Bowen  added. The Spurs were coming off a home game against Portland just 24
hours earlier and it showed in several missed layups, many of them
by Parker and  Manu Ginobili , who was 6-of-15 for 16 points. "I wasn't concerned about shooting. I was flat. I couldn't find
my energy," Ginobili said. "So, I was more concerned about
defense than my shooting. Shooting can happen. You have to play
good defense." Iverson's point exactly. "It wasn't just steals. It was also making them take tough
shots. Nothing easy and everything contested," Ginobili said. Although Duncan added 13 rebounds, he was an uncharacteristic
3-of-10 from the line, and San Antonio had trouble putting away the
Nuggets, who played one of their best games since losing star
 Carmelo Anthony  to a 15-game suspension last month for fighting. The Nuggets led 49-48 at halftime, but Duncan's bucket in the
opening seconds of the third quarter gave San Antonio the lead for
good. In the final few minutes, they iced the game with key stops and
 Matt Bonner  had two key baskets down the stretch, including a sweet
sky hook. Although the rust showed in his game, Smith scored 12 points and
helped spread the court for Iverson. "He helped us a lot," Iverson said. "He gave us an
opportunity to win." Smith was at the center of the fight between the Nuggets and New
York Knicks that spilled into the stands at Madison Square Garden
on Dec. 16, which led to 10 ejections and seven suspensions. Anthony, the NBA's leading scorer, got the harshest punishment,
a 15-game suspension. Smith got a loud ovation when he checked in with 5:35 remanning
in the first quarter and an even louder one when he took a pass
from Iverson from the top of the circle for an alley-oop dunk for
his first points. "It was nice to play against somebody else," Smith said. "I
wasn't necessarily rusty, I just wasn't used to running." Smith played 32 minutes and although he didn't start, he did
finish the game. "I wasnt as tired as I was earlier this season," Smith said.
"I have been on the treadmill a lot and played with Melo 1-on-1,
fullcourt. So that helped a lot." He also liked the standing ovation he got. "The reception was great," Smith said. "The fans were really
great. I can't wait until Melo comes back and see what they do for
him." Anthony comes back Jan. 22, when Denver plays Memphis at the
Pepsi Center. Iverson, however, is looking forward to the preceding Monday,
when the Nuggets begin a four-day respite, their longest until the
All-Star break in February. He's been playing with a sore big toe on his right foot and said
it's still very painful. "I wish you wouldn't have said nothing about it," Iverson
said. "It got a little bit more painful as soon as you said
something about it." But not as painful as letting one get away. Game notes The Nuggets are 4-7 during Anthony's suspension and 6-14
overall without him during his career. ... San Antonio held Denver
to a season low in points. The Nuggets had 84 against Utah on
Saturday.
