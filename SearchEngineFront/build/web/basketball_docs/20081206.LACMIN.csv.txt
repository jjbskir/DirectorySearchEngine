MINNEAPOLIS -- If Randy Wittman's job wasn't in trouble before Saturday night, it most likely is now. His  Minnesota Timberwolves  suffered their second straight blowout loss, this one a 107-84 thumping at the hands of the lowly  Los Angeles Clippers  on their home floor that brought a season full of misery to a new low. Baron Davis  had 27 points and nine assists, and  Zach Randolph  scored 21 for the Clippers to extend Minnesota's losing streak to five games and snap their own three-game skid. Marcus Camby  added 12 points, 19 rebounds and seven blocks for the Clippers, who entered the night as one of just three teams in the NBA with fewer victories than Minnesota (4-15). That is no longer the case after an embarrassing performance by the Wolves, who got 28 points and eight rebounds from  Al Jefferson . After the game, most of the talk centered around Wittman, who is 38-105 since taking over for Dwane Casey in January 2007. "There's nothing you can worry about," Wittman said. "When you get hired, you're bound to get fired. You don't worry about it. I'm not. You've got to prepare each day. That's what I've got to continue to do. Kevin Love  added 13 points and 15 rebounds, but it wasn't enough for the Wolves, who lost by 29 points at New Jersey on Friday night and trailed by as many as 29 points in the second half of this one. At home. To the Clippers (4-16). Enough said. "Randy Wittman is not out there on the court. Kevin McHale is not out there on the court," Wolves guard  Randy Foye  said. "It's me, Al, Craig (Smith), Ryan (Gomes), and these guys in here. It has to change within us before anything." There really were no excuses for Minnesota in this one. The Wolves were playing without  Mike Miller , who missed his second straight game with an ankle injury. But the Clippers are also banged up, with both  Chris Kaman  and  Ricky Davis  continuing to be out with knee injuries. The Wolves were playing the second game of a back-to-back coming off a 113-84 loss in New Jersey. But the Clippers were also on a back-to-back and coming off a 12-point loss in Memphis. Los Angeles looked well-rested and hungry, holding the uninspired Wolves to 20 percent shooting in the first quarter and enjoying huge advantages in rebounds (54-38) and second-chance points (20-7). "We've been struggling. We didn't get out to the best of starts and we wanted to salvage the rest of this road trip," Camby said. "Just tried to come out there with a lot of energy." Having lost five of their previous six games to opponents with a combined winning percentage of just .431, the road gets even tougher now for Minnesota with the next eight opponents winning at a .623 clip, starting with Utah on Tuesday. The players tried to take the attention away from Wittman and put it on their shoulders. "They could do whatever they wanted to do," Jefferson said of Wolves management. "But it starts right here in this locker room with us. Jesus Christ himself could come out here and coach us, but if we don't go out there and play hard and play together, it won't mean nothing." The Clippers led by 14 after one and 23 after three to turn this one into a laugher and a nice bounce-back game following the ugly loss to the Grizzlies to finish the road trip 1-4. "We let one get away in Dallas, and then we laid an egg last night," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "It was good to see us come back strong tonight." Game notes  Dunleavy said he hoped to have Kaman back by next Friday's game against Portland. ... Wittman spent the afternoon at Williams Arena watching his son Ryan, one of the best players in the Ivy League, play for Cornell against Minnesota. Ryan scored 21 points, but Cornell lost 71-54.
