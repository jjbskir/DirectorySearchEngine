SAN ANTONIO -- When  Bruce Bowen  has an open 3-pointer,  Tim Duncan  wants him to take it. "People are going to leave him for that shot," Duncan said. "His entire career they have and I still don't know why. He loves to line it up and we love for him to take that shot."
 Elias Says The Spurs rolled to yet another easy victory, this one by a 110-91 score over the Sonics. And, as Gregg Popovich prepares his veteran team for the playoffs, once again no San Antonio player logged as much as 30 minutes of playing time.  Tuesday's game marked the fifth since Feb. 7 in which no Spurs player has played 30 or more minutes in a game (and the Spurs have won each of those games by at least 15 points). All other NBA teams combined have played only two such games over that span!  Read more  Elias Says . Bowen tied his career high with six 3-pointers and scored 18 points, leading the Spurs to a 110-91 victory over the  Seattle SuperSonics  on Tuesday night and a sweep of the four-game season series. "It's great when you get an opportunity to shoot that many times when you're open," said Bowen, who was 6-of-9 behind the arc. "I got a chance to get some shots up. As compared to other games, it may not be like that. It's always good. You know, I've been here before." Bowen has hit six 3s twice before in his career, including once earlier this season. Tony Parker  had 16 points and Duncan added 14 for the Spurs, who had five players in double figures. Though the game was rarely close, it wasn't as bad as the beating the Sonics took late last month, when the Spurs beat them 120-79 for one of Seattle's worst home losses in franchise history. The Sonics' 19-point loss Tuesday was the closest they've come to the Spurs all season. "They're a good team, period," forward  Rashard Lewis  said. "They just show how far ahead they are of us. We've got a lot more learning to do. A lot more improving to do." Chris Wilcox  led Seattle with 20 points, followed by Lewis with 19 and  Johan Petro  with 14. "Every time we doubled on Duncan ... they found the open man on the wing and they just shot well from the 3-point line," Lewis said. Only four Spurs players didn't hit a 3-pointer in last month's rout, when San Antonio's 16 3s established a franchise record. The 3s were contained to two players Tuesday -- but there were still plenty of them. And that was even without  Brent Barry , a 45 percent 3-point shooter who is third in the league. He was out with back spasms. Bowen's last 3 of the game, which he hit from the corner with 5 minutes left in the third, gave the Spurs a 20-point lead. Michael Finley  hit three 3s to help the Spurs finish 9-of-21 (43 percent) from behind the arc. Seattle was 2-of-8 (25 percent). Finley, who started in place of Barry, had 13 points and has scored in double digits in his last six games. Fabricio Oberto  had 11 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio. Down 26 points to open the fourth, two short of their biggest deficit of the game, Seattle went on an 8-0 run to make it 91-73. It was the closest the Sonics got in the fourth. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich subbed out his last starter about three minutes into the period. Only starter  Damien Wilkins  remained in for Seattle until the end. The Spurs outrebounded the Sonics 41-22. "They have two 7-footers on the floor. We have two forwards. They're a lot longer than we are, they got a lot of those rebounds and I don't know what else to say," Sonics coach Bob Hill said. The Spurs also had 26 assists, including seven from Duncan, to the Sonics' 18. "If one guy's got a shot he takes it," Seattle's  Nick Collison  said. "If he doesn't, he just moves the ball and they play like that and it's tough to catch up." Game notes  Spurs F  Robert Horry  was out with an abdominal contusion. ...
