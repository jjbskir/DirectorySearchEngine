 Kidd had 14 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his 76th
career triple-double, Carter added 25 points and 11 rebounds, and
the Nets beat the Raptors 102-92 on Wednesday night. Kidd stole the show in the final quarter with eight points, four
assists and four rebounds. The point guard had four points and
three assists in a quarter-opening, 18-8 spurt that gave New Jersey
a 92-78 lead in what had been a closely contested contest. Richard Jefferson , the other member of the Nets' big three,
added 16 points, while  Nenad Krstic  and  Bostjan Nachbar  had 14
points apiece. Anthony Parker, the free agent signed after playing in Israel,
had 22 points to lead the Raptors, who are trying to transform
themselves into the  Phoenix Suns  of the north.  T.J. Ford , who was
acquired in a trade with Milwaukee, added 19 points and seven
assists.  Chris Bosh  had 14 points on a terrible 5-for-13 shooting
night during which he was called for five fouls. The game also marked the NBA debuts of two of the Raptors'
highly publicized European imports, No. 1 overall draft pick Andrea
Bargnani of Italy and free agent forward Jorge Garbajosa of Spain.
Neither was very impressive. Bargnani played just under nine foul-plagued minutes, collecting
more fouls (3) than points (2). The 21-year-old center was 1-of-3
from the field with a delay-of-game warning for taking a shot after
walk. Garbajosa played 20 minutes, but only had two points on 1-of-8
shooting and five rebounds. Carter helped the Nets take the lead for good late in the third
quarter, handing out three assists in a late 8-2 spurt that put New
Jersey ahead 74-70. Jefferson started the fourth quarter with a driving basket and
Kidd followed two free throws by Parker with a pair of jump shots
for an 80-72 lead. After Toronto got within 80-76, Kidd led an 11-2 spurt by
setting up two baskets by Nachbar -- one a 3-pointer-- and one by
 Jason Collins . Carter added a 3-pointer in the run and Jefferson
made a free throw, also set up by a pass from Kidd. Game notes Nets F  Clifford Robinson  missed the game, serving part of
his five-game suspension for violating the NBA drug policy during
the playoffs. He will also miss Friday at Miami. ... Seven Italian
reporters and three TV crews were on hand for Bargnani's debut. The
game was broadcast live to Italy. Four Spanish reporters and two TV
crews were present for Garbajosa's debut. ... The officiating crew
called three carries in the game and one double dribble. ... Nets
first-round draft pick Marcus Williams had seven points.
