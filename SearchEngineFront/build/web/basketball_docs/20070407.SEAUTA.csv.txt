SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Trailing by 20 entering the fourth quarter, the  Seattle SuperSonics  were hoping just to get out of Utah with a little dignity. They left with quite a bit. The Sonics outscored Utah 39-16 in the final quarter, rallying to win 106-103 Saturday and humbling the Jazz on the night they unveiled their division championship banner. "Coming out of the huddle going into the fourth quarter, coaches said just keep fighting for the next five minutes," said  Rashard Lewis , who scored 28 of his 35 points in the second half. After that first five minutes, the Sonics had taken a blowout and made it interesting. After 10 minutes, what was once a 22-point margin was down to three, and in the final minute the Sonics completed the comeback by passing the Jazz and hanging on to win it. Seattle was 6-for-8 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter. "We finally hit our rhythm and those 3s came up big," Lewis said. "We was able to pull within 10 and kind of took over the game from there." Earl Watson  had 15 points and nine assists, and  Nick Collison  added 14 points and seven rebounds in helping the Sonics end a four-game losing streak. "You remember the season as a whole, but it is a good win," Collison said. "It's good for fans and people to see that we're still trying." Seattle was playing on the day All-Star guard  Ray Allen  had surgery on both ankles to remove bone spurs. Guard  Luke Ridnour  didn't travel with the team because of a sprained ankle. The Jazz blew a 17-point lead the night before in a loss at Sacramento, then topped that Saturday at home. Deron Williams  had 24 points and 13 assists, and  Carlos Boozer  had 16 points and 13 rebounds for Utah, which leads Houston by one game for the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The Jazz have lost three straight and are in jeopardy of having to start the playoffs on the road. "We gave up 21 points on turnovers. Some of those were just totally unforced," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "It looked like we hadn't played with each other. That's what happens when the pressure gets on you a little bit. We've got to learn how to deal with it." The Jazz could have increased the lead over the Rockets to two games had they been able to hang on in the fourth quarter. But Seattle started hitting from outside and didn't stop until Lewis hit a 13-footer that put the Sonics up 102-101 with 21 seconds left. Collison added two free throws and Lewis hit two more from the line with 0.9 seconds left. Utah had time for one last shot, but  Derek Fisher  had to rush after catching the inbounds pass, and his 3-point attempt hit the top of the backboard as time expired. "I don't think we lost the game in last minute or last couple of minutes," said  Mehmet Okur , who scored 10 for Utah. "If you look at the second half, we gave them what they want. They score every time they catch the ball. We cannot play this way in the playoffs." Utah outrebounded Seattle 38-25, but also put Seattle on the free throw line 23 times. The Sonics hit 16 free throws, twice as many as the Jazz. The Jazz led 87-67 entering the fourth quarter, but the Sonics went on a 15-4 run, cutting Utah's lead to 91-82 on Watson's layup.  Mickael Gelabale  made a 3-pointer to get the Sonics within 93-85, then Collison stuffed Fisher's layup attempt at one end and dunked it a few seconds later to cut the margin to six points. Seattle continued to get closer, and Watson's 3-pointer with 2:04 trimmed Utah's lead to 97-94 as the Sonics continued to hit almost ever shot they took from beyond the arc. Gelabale's 3-pointer got Seattle within 101-100 with 54 seconds left.  Matt Harpring  made a bad pass for Utah and Watson came up with it, setting up Lewis' go-ahead shot. Game notes   Paul Millsap  scored 12, and Harpring and  Gordan Giricek  had 10 points apiece for Utah. ... Jazz F  Andrei Kirilenko  sat out with a thumb injury. ... Lewis, Collison and Watson were the only players to score in double figures for Seattle. And none of the Sonics had more than eight rebounds. ... Seattle and Utah tied the season series 2-2.
