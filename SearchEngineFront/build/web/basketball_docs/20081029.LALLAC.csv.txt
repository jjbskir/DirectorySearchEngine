LOS ANGELES --  Kobe Bryant  didn't shoot much, didn't score much and didn't need to. Bryant led seven  Los Angeles Lakers  in double figures with 16 points on 5-of-12 shooting and had eight rebounds Wednesday night in a 117-79 blowout that spoiled the  Los Angeles Clippers ' season opener. Andrew Bynum  added 12 points and nine rebounds,  Derek Fisher  and  Jordan Farmar  scored 15 each,  Pau Gasol  had 13,  Trevor Ariza  11 and  Chris Mihm  10. "It feels good to be out there working together, being aggressive and playing hard," said Gasol, who had nine rebounds and is a force at forward since he no longer has to fill in at center. The new-look Clippers seemed essentially like their usual sub .500 selves, no match for the talent and versatility of the defending Western Conference champion Lakers. Baron Davis  had 11 points on 4-of-13 shooting in his Clippers' debut, with seven assists.  Al Thornton  scored 16 points, and  Cuttino Mobley  and  Tim Thomas  each had 11. "It was a rude awakening for us, to let us see that mountain we've got to climb," Davis said. "Did I expect to lose like that? No. Do I expect us to go 0-7? No. "We're going to just have to figure it out on the fly." The Lakers began their season with a similar rout a night earlier, breezing to a 96-76 win at home against Portland on Tuesday. Even coach Phil Jackson didn't expect the Lakers' opening two games to be so one-sided. "We have to say it's a surprise, (but) our team is playing at a high level," he said. "Our next game is on the road (at Denver on Saturday), so it's a team that has a lot of animosity I'm sure from last year's playoffs. We'll see how we do when we go to their place." The Lakers swept Denver in the first round. As they did against the Trail Blazers, the Lakers played suffocating defense, holding the Clippers to 38 percent shooting while shooting 51 percent themselves and going 10-of-19 from 3-point range. Bynum, back after a knee injury last January that sidelined him for the rest of the season, went 4-of-7 from the floor and helped jam up the middle on defense, blocking three shots. "We went out there and played great defense tonight again, and as long as we hold teams to under 80 points, I think we're doing a pretty good job," Bynum said. "I think the record for that is six straight (under 80) and we're going to try and go after it." The Lakers' depth, he said, helps on both ends of the court. "Everybody came in from the starting five to the second unit and moved the ball around and got a bunch of fast break points," he said. The Clippers, who lost longtime mainstay  Elton Brand  and  Corey Maggette  among others during the offseason, have nine newcomers who played for other teams last season. Davis played just one preseason game because of a finger injury, and another new addition,  Marcus Camby , is out with a bruised right heel. Down 33-32, the Lakers got some spark from the reserves and reeled off a 24-6 string beginning with Farmar's running jumper with 8:18 remaining in the second quarter. Ariza scored eight points during the run and Farmar had five points, three assists and a rebound. That helped the Lakers open a 56-39 lead with 1:06 remaining and they were up 59-44 at halftime. They outscored the Clippers 26-13 in the third quarter and were ahead 85-57 heading into the final quarter. Game notes  Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said before the game he thinks the Lakers may be the best club in the NBA. "Defensively they should be one of the top three teams and then they've got Kobe Bryant at the end of the game to cancel all bets," Dunleavy said. "If I'm picking, that's who I'm picking to win it all if they're healthy." ... The Clippers finished 23-59 last season while the Lakers kept going until they lost Game 6 to Boston in the NBA finals. ... The Lakers went 4-0 against the Clippers last season, winning by an average of 26 points.
