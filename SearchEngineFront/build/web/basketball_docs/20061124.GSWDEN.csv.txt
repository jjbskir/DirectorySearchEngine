DENVER (AP) -- George Karl pushed and prodded his Nuggets to
speed up the game. "We can push it faster," the Denver coach implored.

 Denver beat Golden State 140-129. There has been only one non-overtime NBA game in the past 14 seasons in which more points were scored: The Clippers beat the Raptors 152-120 on March 13, 1998. (There was one other game during the past 14 seasons with exactly 269 points: The Celtics beat the Hawks 137-132 on April 14, 2004.)

 The Nuggets were already leading the league in scoring, so how
much faster could they go? Denver found another gear in a 140-129
win over the  Golden State Warriors  on Friday night. It's the most points the Nuggets have scored since a 140-122 win
over Sacramento on March 29, 1991. Golden State hadn't give up that
many since surrendering 143 against Portland on Jan. 26, 1993. "It (felt) like a recreation game,"  Carmelo Anthony  said.
"You're just out there running. You score and they come back down
and score, keep going back and forth." Anthony and  J.R. Smith  provided a solid 1-2 punch for Denver.
Anthony had 30 points -- he's now scored 30 or more in eight of his
last nine games -- and Smith added 31, including four 3-pointers. "We've gotten to know each other. We're like twins," Smith
said. The emergence of Smith has taken the pressure off of Anthony. He
doesn't feel like he has to carry the scoring load by himself. "I'm trying to find him," Anthony said. "I'm trying to get
everyone involved early in the game." Defense was definitely optional in this game. Neither side had
many stops. "This was unheard of," Warriors guard  Jason Richardson  said.
"This was depressing." The loss spoiled a career-high 31 points for  Andris Biedrins . "I like the 31 points," he said. "I like winning better. We
just played really bad defense." The Nuggets didn't play much better on the defensive end and
know a lecture from Karl is waiting. "The offense we're playing right now, I think we can be (a
great) team," Anthony said. "With the defense, we can't." Anthony was handed a stat sheet after the game and studied it,
shaking his head in admiration. The stats weren't from Denver's
game, but  Allen Iverson 's 46-point outburst against Chicago. "Not a bad game," Anthony said, looking at Iverson's numbers. Anthony still leads the league in scoring -- barely. He's
averaging 30.9 and Iverson now has a 30.4-point average. That
wasn't on his mind after the game, though. "We almost had 150 points, that's impressive," he said. "I've
never done that before. You can't get mad at the win." The Warriors were without  Baron Davis , who didn't make the trip
because of a strained muscle in his ribs.  Matt Barnes  scored 21
points for the Warriors and Richardson added 18. Golden State coach Don Nelson was disturbed by his team's 26
turnovers. "The turnovers let us down," he said. "Most of them were
self-inflicted. You don't want to shoot yourself in the foot or
you'll have a game like that against somebody that is looking to
run the ball." The up-and-down game wasn't surprising, since Denver entered the
contest leading the league in points per game (108.3) and Golden
State was fourth (105.8). Earl Boykins  had 10 assists and 17 points for the Nuggets. He'd
missed the last two games with a stomach virus. "My energy level is a lot better," he said. Ask him again in the morning after playing in a basketball game
that turned into a track meet. Game notes The Warriors took to the road after a seven-game homestand.
