CHICAGO -- After missing three games with a hamstring injury and struggling with his shot,  Luol Deng  made it clear that he's back up to speed. Deng scored a season-high 26 points, and  Ben Gordon  added 21 to help the  Chicago Bulls  beat the  Washington Wizards  117-110 on Saturday night. "I always have my confidence," Deng said. "Just some games I was struggling out there. What I got to do is be more aggressive more often even when the shot is not falling try to stay with it. I was slowed down with the injury a little bit, but now I'm feeling better." Deng, who signed a six-year contract extension in the offseason, was shooting just 41 percent from the field coming into the game, but finished the game 11-for-19. "He was aggressive and he was cutting to the basket well and our guys found him. This is progression for Luol. In some of his slow games it was not just him," Bulls coach  Vinny Del Negro  said. Former Washington player  Larry Hughes  added 24 points, and  Derrick Rose  had 15 points and eight assists for Chicago. Caron Butler  finished with 27 points, six assists and eight rebounds for Washington, and  Antawn Jamison  added 23 points and 12 rebounds. The Wizards dropped to 3-15 for the first time since the 1966-67 season, when they were known as the Baltimore Bullets. "It's tough. I've never been in this situation like this before," Butler said. "We're giving a lot of effort and we're giving a lot of energy but we're still falling short." With Chicago leading 69-68 midway through the third quarter,  Andres Nocioni  hit a 3 to start a 10-0 run and Gordon hit another 3 to give the Bulls a 79-68 lead. The Bulls closed the third quarter by outscoring the Wizards 19-6, a run highlighted by Gordon's block on  Antonio Daniels ' layup attempt. Nocioni made another 3 with 22.4 seconds left in the quarter to give Chicago a 88-72 lead. One night after losing to the Lakers 106-104, the Wizards failed to defend against the Bulls. Chicago shot 52.4 percent and scored 24 points off the Wizards' 16 turnovers. "One of the things you can't succumb to frustration. We have to keep a positive attitude," Wizards interim head coach Ed Tapscott said.
