CLEVELAND (AP) -- They started the season expecting to be among
the NBA's elite teams. And so far, the  Cleveland Cavaliers  are. LeBron James  scored 37 points and  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  matched a
season high with 14, leading the Cavaliers to their fifth straight
win, 92-76 over the  Minnesota Timberwolves  on Friday night.

 James LeBron James led the Cavaliers in points (37), rebounds (9, tied with Drew Gooden) and assists (6) in Cleveland's win over Minnesota. It was the first time this season that King James led the team in all three categories. Last season, LeBron led his team in points, rebounds and assists in 16 games, the highest such total for any player in the league.

 James added nine rebounds and six assists for the Cavs, who
improved to an Eastern Conference-best 7-2 and won their first game
without guard  Larry Hughes . He sprained his right ankle Wednesday
against Portland and could miss several games. It's a significant loss, but the Cavaliers are used to playing
without Hughes. He missed 46 games with a broken finger last
season, but Cleveland managed to go 27-19 in his absence. "It shows the caliber of team we are," James said. "We feel
we're one of the best teams in the league. We're proving that right
now." Kevin Garnett  scored a season-low 14 on 5-of-17 shooting and
rookie  Craig Smith  had 12 for the Timberwolves, who scored only 31
points in the second half and lost for the fifth time in six games. Minnesota's  Ricky Davis  was just 2-of-10 and had four points --
10 below his average -- and the Timberwolves shot 29 percent
(10-of-35) from the floor after halftime. "Our offense in the second half disappeared," coach Dwayne
Casey said. "Thirty-one points? You can't expect to beat teams on
the road like that." Ilgauskas, who has averaged 14.9 points in his career, came in
getting just 7.6 per game as the 7-foot-3 center has struggled in
Cleveland's new motion offense. But the big man scored his 14 in
three quarters before sitting the entire fourth. He wasn't needed as James -- Cleveland's biggest man -- took over.
He scored 13 points and hit one of three 3-pointers in the fourth
when the Cavaliers opened an 18-point lead and coasted. Cleveland was only up by four early in the fourth when Damon
Jones, who finished with 11 points, hit a jumper and James fed
 Sasha Pavlovic  for a 3-pointer to trigger a 13-2 spurt that put the
Timberwolves away. After James drained a 3-pointer to make it 81-68, Cleveland's
superstar stayed back and watched as his teammates took off up
court on a fast break. Pavlovic threaded a crosscourt pass
underneath to  Anderson Varejao , who left a bounce bass for Donyell
Marshall, who dunked to make it 83-68 with 3:23 to go. James finished one point under his season high and got to enjoy
the final 1:10 from the bench. "I didn't force anything," he said. Garnett did, and never found his touch. "I rushed a lot of shots," said Garnett, who had 11 rebounds
and five steals. "In the fourth they made their run and we never
answered it. It was one of those nights, but that's the beauty of
this league, there's tomorrow." Hughes, who has been injury prone during his pro career, arrived
at the arena on crutches and in a walking boot. He doesn't know
when he'll be back and said he won't place any weight on his leg
until Monday -- at the earliest. The Cavaliers play at Washington on Saturday and have four games
in five days next week. Game notes The Cavs are 7-2 for the fourth time. Only the 1976-77
squad that started 8-1 got off to a better start. ... It's great to
be King. James had no worries about landing a precious PlayStation
3. He already had one. The gaming system went on sale Friday,
causing long lines and fights outside stores nationwide. "I didn't
wait outside either," James said. "I have a lot of connections."
... Garnett moved past Reggie Theus into 59th place on the career
steals list with 1,208. ... Minnesota C  Mark Blount  needed stitches
to close a cut in his head opened by an elbow from James, who was
called for his first career flagrant foul. ... James' No. 23 jersey
was outnumbered by various Ohio State jerseys dotting the arena. He
