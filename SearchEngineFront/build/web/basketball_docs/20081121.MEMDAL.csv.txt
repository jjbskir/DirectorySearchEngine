 "That's why you have star players, to play like stars," Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. Jason Terry  added 20 points for the Mavericks, returning from a 3-0 road trip. Dallas had been beaten at home by playoff contenders Houston, Cleveland, the  Los Angeles Lakers  and Orlando before getting on track against Memphis. "This has been a strong home court for so many years, so to start off with losses was difficult," Carlisle said. "We have to continue to build momentum." The Mavericks won 34, 36 and 34 games at home in the previous three seasons, making the poor early performance all the more alarming. "We played pretty good basketball on the road," Kidd said. "With the success we've had here at home, we kind of relied on that. We knew we had to take the same approach here that we did on the road." O.J. Mayo  scored 19 points, and  Mike Conley  and  Rudy Gay  added 14 apiece for the Grizzlies, who've lost 12 straight to the Mavericks and are 7-45 all-time against Dallas. Nowitzki went 4-for-11 from the floor in the first half, but he heated up in the third quarter, accounting for 11 of Dallas' first 13 points and assisting on a basket by Kidd to put the Mavericks in front, 57-46. Kidd, who added six assists in the game, delivered a crowd-pleasing, no-look touch pass to feed  James Singleton  for a layup later in the third quarter, pushing Dallas' lead to 62-48. Nowitzki was involved on both ends of a third-quarter sequence, blocking Mayo's layup attempt, then hustling to the offensive end where he hit an 18-foot jumper. Kidd had eight points and eight rebounds in the third quarter, and Dallas carried a 68-56 advantage into the final period. "We were playing a real good game, but they got a couple of easy baskets and then they started going to Nowitzki, and we don't have an answer for Nowitzki," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. Kidd hit a 3-pointer and converted a layup on the next possession as the Mavericks extended their lead to 88-72 with 2:20 left. Memphis' starting lineup includes rookies Mayo,  Darrell Arthur , and  Marc Gasol , and the other two starters, Gay and Conley, have a combined three years of NBA experience. The inexperience showed, especially in the third quarter when the Grizzlies went 6-for-27 from the field in the face of stepped-up Mavericks defense. "I think we were forcing it a little too much," Gay said. Dallas shot only 33 percent in the first half (14-for-43) but the Mavericks scored the final seven points of the second quarter and held a 44-41 lead at the break behind Terry's 15 points. Despite the halftime edge, Carlisle wasn't pleased with his team's early performance. "Coach was upset with us about the first half," Kidd said. "He called us out. He talked to us about, one, playing defense, and two, making some shots." Game notes  Dallas' No. 2 scorer,  Josh Howard  (20.3 ppg), missed his second straight game with a left ankle injury. ...
