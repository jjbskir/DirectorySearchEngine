TORONTO (AP) --  Chris Bosh  said the  Toronto Raptors  would have lost a game like this last year. Bosh scored a season-high 35 points, including a tying 3-pointer with 1:01 left, as the Raptors rallied from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the  New Orleans Hornets  90-88 on Wednesday night. Jose Calderon  had four points and a block in the final 30 seconds for the Raptors. Toronto outscored New Orleans 26-9 over the final 7  minutes. "Last year we probably get down by 20 and put our heads down and that's a wrap," Bosh said. "That's the thing I like about this team. We keep our eyes on the prize." The Raptors went 93-153 during Bosh's first three years in the league, but he's led them to a 21-22 record this season. "It feels good to steal one. People steal ones from us all the time since I've been here, so it feels good for the tables to turn," Bosh said. Bosh pumped his fists after his 3-pointer tied the score at 81. Calderon followed with a layup to give Toronto its first lead of the game with 28.4 seconds left.  Bobby Jackson  tried to drive past Calderon for a layup on the next play, but Calderon blocked his shot and followed with two free throws. Jackson followed with a layup with 14.6 seconds left, but Bosh made two free throws with 13.8 seconds remaining to make it a four-point lead. Bosh finished 11-for-19 from the field and 12-for-18 from the line. "We didn't feel comfortable on the court. We didn't play a good basketball game, but if we fight for 48 minutes, we can win," Calderon said. "Sometimes you don't have to play good to win games." Butler had 19 points for the Hornets, who lost in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. Toronto won despite shooting just 18-for-27 from the line. "They played hard for four minutes of the game," Jackson said of Toronto. "They just wanted it more." The Raptors improved to 3-1 on their five-game homestand. Toronto won despite missing starting point guard  T.J. Ford  and No. 1 pick  Andrea Bargnani . The Hornets began the fourth on a 10-0 run capped by  Devin Brown 's 3-pointer, but Toronto followed with a 14-3 run to cut the lead to three.  Morris Peterson  capped it with a 3-pointer. Toronto outscored New Orleans 26-19 in the fourth. "We were just soft," New Orleans coach Byron Scott said. "We took the bail out, just long jump shots, and that's a sign of a team on the road that just doesn't have a lot of confidence." Game notes  The Hornets are 6-14 on the road. ... Bargnani, the No. 1 pick in the draft, missed the game because of a fever. Ford missed is second straight with a sore ankle. ... The Hornets will play their next five games at home -- the opener against Sacramento in New Orleans on Friday night and then four games at Oklahoma City. ... Calderon finished with 14 points and eight assists.
