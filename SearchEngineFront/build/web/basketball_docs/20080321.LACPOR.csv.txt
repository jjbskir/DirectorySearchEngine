PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) --  LaMarcus Aldridge  is becoming the offensive force that Portland coach Nate McMillan has been envisioning all season. Aldridge had 22 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high seven assists,  Brandon Roy  added 21 points and six assists, and the Trail Blazers beat the  Los Angeles Clippers  107-102 on Friday night. Martell Webster  had 16 points and  Steve Blake  had 15 points and 11 assists for Portland, which has slim playoff hopes but has seen the emergence of Aldridge as a low-post complement to All-Star guard Roy. "It becomes a simple game when you've got a guy who can score in the low post," McMillan said. "That's a weapon, that's an option we were hoping to develop this season and it's happening." Cuttino Mobley  scored 22 of his 24 points in the second half, and  Josh Powell  added 21 for the Clippers. Los Angeles has lost six straight and 14 of 16 and was missing leading scorer  Corey Maggette  because of a sore shoulder. Dan Dickau  had 14 points and seven assists,  Smush Parker  had 14 points and six assists, and  Quinton Ross  had 12 points for Clippers, who host Portland on Saturday at the Staples Center. The Clippers outscored Portland 27-20 in the fourth quarter, and got within three points on a 3-pointer from Mobley, but  Jarrett Jack  hit two free throws for Portland to seal the win. Roy had just two points in the first quarter but bounced back from a 3-for-14 shooting night against Phoenix on Tuesday. He's averaging 22.7 points over his last 10 games. With center  Chris Kaman  (back) missing his seventh straight game, the Clippers had difficulties stopping Aldridge, who was 11-of-18 from the field and has scored at least 20 points in each of the past eight games. He has led Portland in scoring in the last three games and five of the last eight. Roy has led the Blazers in the other three. "The young fellows, Roy and Aldridge, I love their game," Mobley said. "They're smart and know how to play." Aldridge got the best of rookie  Al Thornton , who struggled through a 2-for-10 shooting night for the Clippers and finished with just five points. The Blazers are 6½ games behind Golden State for the last playoff spot in the Western Conference. Aldridge was almost unstoppable from the beginning, hitting his first seven shots and finishing the first quarter with 14 points and five rebounds to give Portland a 32-24 lead. The Clippers adjusted, throwing double-teams at Aldridge when he touched the ball. "I'm learning," he said. "I watched film and saw how they were double-teaming me last time. I made a conscious effort to find guys open." Parker came in off the bench and energized the Clippers, hitting his first five shots and getting Los Angeles within 41-39. Dickau hit a 3 to put the Clippers ahead 48-46 and converted a three-point play to put them up by four. Powell, Ross, Dickau and Parker were a combined 18-of-21 and Los Angeles shot 64 percent in the first half to go into the break tied at 57. "We played hard, played together," Powell said. "This was one of our better games on both ends of the floor." The Blazers tightened up their defense in the third and began to pull away, going on a 16-3 run to make it 77-64. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Blake, who had 10 in the quarter, and Webster extended the lead to 83-67. The Blazers beat the Clippers 82-80 in the teams' first meeting Feb. 27 despite missing Roy.
