ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) --  Allen Iverson  can hit a game-winning shot
even when he's being defended pretty well. Iverson scored 39 points from every angle on the court,
including a driving, fallaway runner from 10 feet out with 2.2
seconds left to give the  Philadelphia 76ers  a 105-103 victory over
the  Orlando Magic  on Friday night.

 Iverson Allen Iverson scored 39 points and distributed 10 assists in Philadelphia's win over Orlando on Friday night. Iverson has 71 points and 16 assists in two games this season. Only two other players in NBA history scored 70-or-more points with 15-or-more assists in their team's first two games of a season: Larry Bird for Boston in 1987 (75 and 15) and Nick Van Exel for Denver in 2001 (71 and 17).

 "I wanted to get in a little closer than I did, but I just took
what the defense gave me and fortunately, it went in," Iverson
said. Magic guard  Keyon Dooling  was all over Iverson on the play. "That wasn't the first time he threw one in like that,"
Dooling said. "He was definitely on tonight. That final shot was
just another example of a great player making a great play when
they needed him." The Magic had a chance to tie the game, but  Grant Hill 's
12-footer at the buzzer was short. Hill, who led the Magic with 25 points, had hit a similar shot
to tie the game at 103 with 12 seconds left, but Iverson answered
that with the game-winner. "They wanted it a little more than we did and that's a little
disappointing," Hill said. Iverson finished 15-of-25, including three 3-pointers, but he
was hardly alone in scoring from the perimeter. Reserve  Kyle Korver 
had 28 points on 10-of-13 shooting, while  Andre Iguodala  and Chris
Webber each added 11 for Philadelphia, which shot 56.1 percent from
the field. The Sixers scored only 26 points in the paint. Korver was a particular sore spot for the Magic, who tried four
different defenders on him, but couldn't find one that could stop
him. He hit all four 3-point attempts and all four free throw shots
in a near-perfect night of shooting. "You can tell Kyle likes the new basketball and if he likes it,
I'll just deal with it," Iverson said. "I call him 'The Sniper'
and he proved it tonight." Hedo Turkoglu  had 15 points and nine rebounds and  Dwight Howard 
finished with 14 points and nine rebounds for the Magic. The Magic hit 53.4 percent (39-of-73) but turnovers and foul
problems kept them from finding a sustained period of success.
Orlando committed 23 turnovers and big men  Tony Battie  and Darko
Milicic played a total of 33 minutes because of foul problems. "When you let a team shoot 56 percent and you commit 23
turnovers, you have to play a perfect game to win," Hill said.
"We didn't play a perfect game. We've got to learn from it and
move on." A three-point play by Dooling sparked a 9-0 run that helped
Orlando cut the deficit to 53-52 at halftime. Iverson hit his first five shots in the third quarter, including
a 3-pointer that gave Philadelphia a 69-60 lead. His streak ended
when the 6-foot-8 Hill took over the defensive assignment. Iverson
didn't score again the rest of the period and the Magic used a 14-3
run to gain a 78-77 lead at the end of the quarter. The Sixers went up 92-86 on a 3-pointer by rookie Rodney Carney
with 7:15 left, but the Magic rallied again. A three-point play by
Hill and 3-pointer by Turkoglu gave the Magic a 99-97 lead with
2:55 left. The Sixers scored six straight points to go up 103-99 with 42
seconds to play, but a dunk by Howard and Hill's driving layup tied
the game at 103 with 12 seconds to play. Game notes Korver was perfect in the first half, hitting all six shots
from the field, including a 3-pointer, and both free throw attempts
for 15 points in 14 minutes. ... Orlando had 20 second-chance
points to just four for the Sixers. ... Milicic had 11 points and
six rebounds in 15 minutes. He picked us his fifth foul with 34
seconds left in the third quarter and didn't return.
