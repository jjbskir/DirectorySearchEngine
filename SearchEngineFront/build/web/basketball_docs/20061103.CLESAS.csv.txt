SAN ANTONIO (AP) --  LeBron James  dunked over  Tim Duncan  with a
snarl, an early statement of a rugged night. And by the time it was
over, the  Cleveland Cavaliers  got out of San Antonio with their
first win in the Alamo City since 1988.

 Cleveland defeated the Spurs 88-81 giving the Cavaliers their first win in San Antonio since Dec. 8, 1988. That was so long ago, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was still an active NBA player in that season. The Cavs' drought of 17 years, 330 days between wins on the road against one opponent was the longest current drought and the fifth-longest for any team in NBA history. The record is 19 years, 81 days between wins by Washington at Seattle (from Jan. 1980 to March 1999).

 James scored 35 points, hitting a key layup and free throw late
in the fourth to help snuff a San Antonio rally and lead the
Cavaliers to an 88-81 victory Friday night. "I was 4 years old the last time we beat San Antonio," in the
Spurs' hometown, James said. "I think for us to become one of the
powerhouses which we've been preaching, we've got to go out there
and walk the walk." But James' night wasn't as easy as it might have looked when he
powered over Duncan for the early slam and scored 15 points in the
first quarter. The Spurs, one of the most dominant homecourt teams in the NBA,
slashed a 13-point deficit in the fourth down to four and might
have won if not for a dismal 18-of-34 effort shooting free throws. "I wish I had a nickel for every time somebody asked me if free
throws are a concern," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. They have
"always been an Achilles' heel." Duncan finished with 25 points and 12 rebounds and scored 14
points in a five-minute span to spark the rally. But he struggled
badly from the line, going 9-of-19. "I've shot a million free throws over the summer," Duncan
said. "But it's nothing like actually getting in a game, banging
around and then having to calm yourself down." James, who missed five consecutive shots in the Spurs' rally,
hit the layup then made one of two free throws for an 86-79 lead
with 42 seconds left. His outlet pass for a dunk by  Larry Hughes ,
who had 18 points, finished it off. "We showed poise down the stretch," James said. "They made a
run and we were able to withstand it." James, who scored 44 points in a game against the Spurs last
season, started strong Friday night against Spurs defensive
specialist  Bruce Bowen . The Spurs managed to quiet James in the second quarter, holding
him to four points, but couldn't find an offensive rhythm to take
the lead. Duncan and spark-plug guard  Tony Parker  were mostly
quiet, combining for 10 points. James finished the half with a highlight layup, again driving
past Duncan for an off-balance shot that he finished with a
giddy-up dance in front of the Cavaliers' bench. "He was fantastic," Popovich said. "He's a physical specimen
and that's the least of his attributes." Cleveland led 62-56 going into the fourth. James started the
final period on the bench but sloppy play by the Spurs helped the
Cavs stretch the lead to 69-56 with free throws and a 3-pointer by
Hughes. When James started missing, the Spurs started their comeback
when Duncan hit a free throw and a dunk. James said he had known about the Cavaliers' long streak of
frustration in San Antonio. "I think for the franchise, it's great to get that off your
back," he said. "This is a great win for us. The Spurs are the
best team in the league." The Spurs have lost only 19 times on their home court since
2003, but two have come in the last two games. The Spurs lost to
Dallas in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals last season. The Spurs, who beat Dallas in their season-opener, are in the
middle of four games in five days. "It's kind of tough," guard  Manu Ginobili  said. "You're a
little rusty and your legs are not the same as January or
February." Game notes Before the game, Spurs F  Robert Horry  spoke to the crowd
and pledged to try to win another NBA championship. The Spurs lost
to Dallas in the Western Conference semifinals last season. "We'd
like to welcome you to another edition of the Spurs show," he
said. ... The Spurs signed G-F James White on Friday. White
averaged 3.8 points and 2.0 rebounds in eight preseason games with
Indiana. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
