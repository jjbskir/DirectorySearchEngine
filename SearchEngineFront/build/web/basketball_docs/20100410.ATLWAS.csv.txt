WASHINGTON --  Jamal Crawford  knows how to deliver an encore performance. One night after leading a victorious Atlanta squad in scoring and in the process connecting on a four-point play, the Hawks' sixth man repeated his heroics across the board against the  Washington Wizards . Crawford scored 23 of his game-high 28 points in the second half, made his NBA- record 28th four-point play and started the decisive 11-0 run in the fourth quarter in Atlanta's 105-95 victory over Washington on Saturday night. "That's my job, to come off [the bench] and figure out how to spark [the team], whether its myself scoring or setting up other guys scoring," said Crawford, who led the Hawks the previous night against Toronto with 25 points. "I just try to play the right way and be aggressive when need be."

 Joe Johnson  scored 20 points to help the Hawks remain in third place in the Eastern Conference. The win also snapped their six-game road losing streak and finished off their season sweep over the Wizards. "I thought in the fourth quarter is when you got to have it and we stepped up," Hawks coach Mike Woodson said. "Our defense really picked up. We were able to score the ball a little bit." Neither team led by more than six points through three quarters and the Hawks trailed 76-71 with 1:34 remaining in the third quarter. But Crawford scored the Hawks next 11 points, including a jumper with 3.2 seconds remaining the quarter that tied it at 78 and he finished off his personal run with a 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter. After the Wizards tied it again at 83, Crawford made another 3-pointer, this one starting a decisive 11-0 run to put the Hawks up 94-83 with 5:56 remaining. He led the Hawks in scoring for the 27th time this season. "He's been huge for us all year," said  Al Horford , who finished with eight points and 10 rebounds. "He's the sixth man of the year. I don't think there is any question about that." Crawford's finishing touch was getting fouled on his fifth made 3-pointer of the night. The subsequent free throw helped him add to his league record four-point play total and gave the Hawks a 103-90 lead with 2:42 remaining. "It has to be concentration. I don't think he practices them, but it's pretty impressive," Horford said about Crawford's ability for making shots from beyond the arc despite contact. "Usually the ball won't even make it to the rim, but he manages to make the shot." Crawford averaged 23.7 points in four games against the Wizards this season. "I try to take advantage of what the defense does," Crawford said. "Usually they panic a little bit and I shoot it. I'm already in shooting motion when they try to react. They are fouling, but I already have the shot off." Andray Blatche  finished with 24 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and  Nick Young  had 23 for the Wizards, who have been swept by the Hawks in consecutive seasons and have lost nine straight overall against the Southeast Division rival. The Hawks, who remain a game ahead of Boston, had their hands full with a resurgent Wizards squad that had won four of six after a 16-game losing streak. Young connected on all three of his 3-point shots, hit eight of his first nine field-goal attempts and scored 19 points, but the Hawks led 52-50 at the end of a competitive first half. With both sides shooting over 50 percent from the floor, there were 13 lead changes, four ties and neither team led by more than six points. Every Atlanta starter made at least half of their attempts and the Wizards shot 72.2 percent (13 for 18) in the first quarter before a sellout crowd of 20,173. The fourth quarter was another story as the Wizards made only six of 19 shots (31 percent) and committed four of their 17 turnovers. "Teams that make the playoffs have guys that make plays in the fourth quarters," Wizards coach Flip Saunders said. "Teams that aren't playoff-type teams have guys that are inconsistent in making those plays. That's the difference between being good and not-so good." Mike Bibby ,  Josh Smith  and  Maurice Evans  all scored 10 points for the Hawks, who made 16 of 18 from the free throw line. Mike Miller  scored 16 points, and  Shaun Livingston  added 15 points for the Wizards. Game notes  The Wizards announced that they have signed guard  Cedric Jackson  for the reminder of the season. Jackson originally signed March 31 and has averaged 1.3 points in three games for the Wizards. ... The Hawks' final two games of the season are against fellow playoff squads. Monday they play at Milwaukee and then return home for the season finale against Cleveland on Wednesday.
