ATLANTA (AP) -- The  Atlanta Hawks  couldn't stop the smallest guy
on the court. Earl Boykins  -- all 5-foot-5 of him -- sparked a 17-1 run at the
start of the fourth quarter that carried the  Denver Nuggets  past
the Hawks 100-87 on Tuesday night.

 The Hawks missed 18 straight field-goal attempts in one stretch of their 100-87 loss to the Nuggets, the longest streak of shooting blanks in the NBA this season.  But don't blame it on the microfiber ball: Four teams had streaks at least that long playing with leather last season.

 While  Carmelo Anthony  scored 26 points, Boykins led the Nuggets
in the final period with nine of his 19 points. He swished a
3-pointer, used his quickness to get free for a couple of pull-up
jumpers and blew by the Hawks to make a driving shot with his left
hand, banking it high off the backboard. "Over the past three or four games, I've felt it coming,"
Boykins said. The Hawks, who lost their third in a row, had no way of
containing the lightning-quick guard when it mattered most. "When he gets going, it's hard to stop him," said  Josh Smith ,
who led the Hawks with 21 points. "He's a scorer at 5-foot-5.
You've got to honor his ability to score. He really made some plays
in the third and fourth quarters to put his team up." Atlanta missed its first 13 shots of the fourth and squandered
four other possessions with turnovers. Combined with five straight
misses at the end of the third, the Hawks actually endured an
0-for-18 stretch from the field. "The biggest difference in the game was getting defensive
stops," Boykins said. "Once we got the stops, we were able to get
the numbers offensively, which led to some easy baskets." They sure could have used their leading scorer.  Joe Johnson , who
is averaging 28.7 points, missed his second straight game with a
strained right calf. "They came with energy on defense," Atlanta's  Zaza Pachulia 
said. "We had no energy in the fourth quarter. I don't know why." By the time  Solomon Jones  scored Atlanta's first field goal of
the period on a layup with 5:11 remaining, the Hawks had managed to
bounce two shots over the backboard without getting one to fall
through the net. Yakhouba Diawara  hit a couple of 3s to help the Nuggets take
control. Anthony had just four points in the final period, but did
manage a thunderous dunk with just over a minute remaining that
drew "ahhhs" from what remained of the crowd. The Hawks returned home after going 2-3 on a West Coast road
trip, which included a 98-96 victory at Denver. In that game,
Johnson scored 27 points to help Atlanta overcome a 17-point
deficit in the final quarter. Denver wasn't about to let it happen again, handing the Hawks
their third straight loss. Since a surprising 4-1 start, Atlanta
has lost 11 of 15 to more resemble a team that hasn't made the
playoffs since 1999. "They basically stole a win from us," Denver's  Marcus Camby 
said. "We had to circle the wagons." The Hawks jumped out to a 10-point lead in the first 7 minutes
and appeared to be in control again when they closed the first half
with a 13-2 spurt. Atlanta went to the locker room with a 54-43
lead at the break. But Denver whittled away at the deficit and went up 71-70 on
Boykins' 19-foot jumper with 8 seconds left in the third. That was just a preview of the Nuggets' domination in the final
quarter. "We couldn't make a shot," Atlanta coach Mike Woodson said.
"We were living on jump shots instead of trying to drive the
basketball. When you're not making shots, you have to try to get to
the free-throw line." Not that it would have helped much. The Hawks made only 14-of-21
at the foul line. Game notes The Nuggets dominated the boards, led by Camby with 17
