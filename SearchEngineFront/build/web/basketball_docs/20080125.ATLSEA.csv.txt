 A Seattle Storm Atlanta's Marvin Williams, a Seattle-area native, hasn't had too many pleasant return trips to his hometown as an NBA player. He more than made up for his past trips with Friday night's 33-point night, which set a career high. Here's a look:

 	   Williams, who grew up in Bremerton, just a ferry ride away from
Seattle, had 16 points in the first half as the Hawks blew away the
Sonics early to end a four-game losing streak. He also scored 11
points in the fourth quarter to hold off a late rally by the
Sonics. 	   "This could be maybe my last year ever playing up here so I was
glad I had a big game and we got a win," said Williams, aware the
Sonics could end up moving to Oklahoma City next season. 	   Williams missed Atlanta's game in Seattle last year with a
broken hand and had an uneventful game in his hometown his rookie
season two years ago. 	    Chris Wilcox  scored 18 points and had seven rebounds to lead the
Sonics.  Kevin Durant  added 17 points and  Damien Wilkins  had 14
points. 	   Seattle tied the team-record of 13 consecutive losses set over
the final five games of last season and the first eight this
season. 

   "We've got to find something that's going to help us win,"
Wilcox said. "It's rough right now. It's rough on all of us." 	   Williams shot 12-for-20 from the field and 9-for-12 on free
throws. He also had seven rebounds. 	   "As you go through this league and have the opportunity to go
to your hometown and play in front of your family and friends, it's
special," Atlanta coach Mike Woodson said. "If you can put on a
show like he did, it makes it even more special. He was
spectacular." 	    Al Horford  had 10 points and 16 rebounds for the Hawks.  Josh Smith  added 14 points and  Joe Johnson  had 13 points and 7 assists. 	   Atlanta led by as many as 24 points in the second half. The
Sonics made a late run in the fourth quarter to get within nine
points with 1:21 remaining. 	   But Williams stole the ball and drove the length of the court
for a dunk with 58 seconds remaining. 	   Williams had a team-high 16 points in the first half to give the
Hawks a 52-31 lead. They led by as many as 23 late in the second
quarter. 	   The Sonics shot 30 percent (14-for-46) from the field in the
first half. Durant was 4-for-14 in the half and finished 7-for-21. 	   The Sonics failed to make any kind of dent in the large deficit
until a run in the fourth quarter cut the lead to nine points.
Wilkins scored nine in the final quarter to lead the rally. 	   Williams scored on a variety of shots in the fourth quarter to
hold off the Sonics. He scored on an inside move midway through the
final quarter to break his career high of 26 points set against
Miami in 2005-2006, the first-round picks' rookie season. 	   "That was a hell of game and that's what you want when you come
home," Wilcox said. "He's a good player. He's definitely improved
his game from his first year. He has started to hit his mid-range
jump shot and he has confidence in it. Once you get the confidence,
everything else falls into place." 	   There's not much confidence in the Sonics these days. 	   "I had some great looks," Durant said of his 14 missed shots.
"That's what frustrates me the most, wide-open jump shots. But you
can't put your head down. You need to keep shooting and keep being
aggressive." 	   Durant hit a 3-pointer just before the buzzer as the Sonics beat
Atlanta 126-123 in two overtimes Nov. 16. Damien Wilkins had 41
points to lead the Sonics to the win. Joe Johnson had 39 for the
Hawks. 	   But the rematch belonged to Williams and the Hawks. 	   "The only time we were really in it was in the fourth quarter
when we got it to nine," Seattle coach P.J. Carlesimo said. "When
you don't shoot the ball well, you have to play well on the other
end which we did not do until the second half." 	   Unlike the Sonics, Williams played well the entire game. 	   "They're just struggling right now," Williams said. "I know
exactly how they feel. I was there at one point. They just have to
keep working hard and get better and things will come together for
them." < 	   ^Notes:@ Carlesimo replaced  Nick Collison  in the starting lineup
with Wilcox in an effort to boost the play of Wilcox. ...The Hawks
snapped an eight-game losing streak to Seattle with their first win
since Nov. 9, 2003.
