PHOENIX (AP) --  Mehmet Okur  and the  Utah Jazz  apparently know something about the  Phoenix Suns  that the rest of the NBA does not. Okur scored 19 of his 29 points in the second half, including a decisive 19-footer with 5.1 seconds remaining, and the Jazz beat Phoenix 108-105 Saturday night for their third win over the Suns this season. Deron Williams  added 28 points and 10 assists for the Jazz, who have handed Phoenix three of its 10 losses this season and have won four straight against the Suns overall. "This year when we've played them we've tried to defend them and cut down on some of their baskets," Williams said. "That's hard to do. We try to make them work on the defensive end and that's why we've had success." The win was Utah's second in three games since  Carlos Boozer  went down with a fractured left fibula. "We have to play 110 percent right now without Boozer, so it was a great win for us," Okur said. Amare Stoudemire  had 28 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Suns, who were without guard  Raja Bell  because of an inflamed right knee. "Tonight we did not come to play and we did not come to play until we got ourselves in a hole," said  Steve Nash , who finished with 22 points and 10 assists. "We finally fought our way back and had a chance to win, but maybe we didn't deserve to win because we didn't really have the attitude we needed to start the game." The Suns had a chance to tie when  Boris Diaw  was fouled by  Derek Fisher  with 2.1 seconds remaining. But Diaw missed both free throws and Okur pulled down the rebound and was fouled immediately. Okur made the first free throw to give Utah a 108-105 lead but missed the second and the Suns secured the rebound with 1.1 seconds left. Andrei Kirilenko  deflected  Leandro Barbosa 's inbound attempt out of bounds with 0.3 seconds remaining and Phoenix was unable to attempt a tying shot. "We can't play their game," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "We can't get in a running game with them. But if we execute we feel we can get decent shots. We have to be in a half-court game and I think we did a pretty decent job trying to stay in it." James Jones  added 16 points for Phoenix, which has lost two of three after winning a franchise-record 17 straight. Phoenix is 1-7 against the Western Conference's other top four teams -- Dallas, San Antonio, Utah and the  Los Angeles Lakers  -- with the lone win coming Thursday against the Spurs. The Suns rallied from an 86-81 deficit at the start of the fourth quarter to take their first lead since the second quarter on Jones' 3-pointer from the right wing with 10:15 remaining. Williams scored five straight points to cap a 10-3 run as Utah regained the lead 96-91 with 7:35 to go. Phoenix answered back, taking a 98-97 lead on Diaw's 3-pointer with 4:54 left. But Okur hit a layup and added a 16-foot turnaround jumper to give Utah the lead for good at 101-99 with 3:23 to play. "That's Mehmet, man," Williams said. "Mehmet is clutch. He loves those shots." Okur finished 13-of-27 and added 12 rebounds for his 15th double-double of the season. Phoenix played most of the second half without  Shawn Marion , who fouled out with 5:12 remaining after scoring only four points on 2-of-7 shooting. "I couldn't get involved in the game tonight," Marion said. "Anything I tried to do it was like I was just taken out of it." Stoudemire dominated inside early, scoring 10 points on 5-of-5 shooting as the Suns opened a 24-16 lead with 3:49 left in the first quarter. The Jazz pulled within a point at the end of the quarter, then used a 12-4 run at the start of the second quarter to take a 41-34 lead. Kirilenko gave Utah its largest lead, 56-41, on a layup with 1:52 left before Nash hit consecutive 3-pointers that helped Phoenix close within 58-49 at halftime. Utah opened a second 15-point lead when  Paul Millsap  scored off an offensive rebound with 7:37 left in the third quarter to make it 68-53. Phoenix twice pulled within two points, the second time when Nash hit a pair of free throws with 2:47 left in the third quarter, before eventually pulling ahead in the fourth. Game notes  Marion fouled out for the fourth time in his career and the first time since November 10, 2003, at Golden State. He also drew a technical foul as he walked off the court after fouling out. ... Sloan raised his career record to 42-41 against the Suns. Sloan, in his 22nd year, has a losing record against only San Antonio and Indiana. ... Reserve guard  Marcus Banks  played 24 minutes for the Suns, one shy of his season high, and Jones played 31 minutes as Phoenix used only seven players. ... After hitting his first six shots, Stoudemire made only three of his final eight attempts. ... Williams has averaged 21.7 points and 10 assists in Utah's three wins against Phoenix.
