EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The  New Jersey Nets  opened their 29-year NBA stay at the Meadowlands with a loss and they ended the run the same way. The constant in both events was Larry Brown. He coached the Nets that night in 1981 against the Knicks and he was back for the final game to guide the  Charlotte Bobcats  over New Jersey 105-95 on Monday night. 
 
 
 
 Sheridan: Ode To The Swamp 
 Good night, Izod Center, but we'll spare you the good riddance treatment. There are just too many vivid memories to say something quite that negative about a place that was the site of so much happenstance, writes Chris Sheridan.    Story 
 
 




 "I was here for the first and the last," Brown said. "What does that tell you? How dumb are these people who keep hiring me? I'm sure over my career I've been in a lot of buildings and outlasted them. Me. Nelly [Don Nelson] and Lenny [Wilkens]. Coach [Jerry] Sloan. I don't know if that's a good thing." The good news for Brown is that his Bobcats (44-37) are headed for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. With Miami's win over Philadelphia earlier Monday, the Bobcats were cemented into the No. 7 playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and will meet the defending conference champion  Orlando Magic  in the first round of the playoffs this weekend. "They got a great coach," Brown said of Stan Van Gundy. "They went to Finals last year and all they did was add  Vince Carter . Every day that  Dwight [Howard]  plays, he's better. They're a team that can win the NBA championship. They have all the things going for them." Stephen Jackson  had 17 points and nine rebounds to lead the Bobcats, but the story of the game for Charlotte was its bench. It outscored New Jersey 50-4 with  Gerald Henderson  getting 14 points,  Tyrus Thomas  13 and  D.J. Augustin  11. "The first half, we just tried to come in and give them a boost," said Henderson, who also had seven rebounds. "When you get in there, you just try to keep it the same or get it better. We played some pretty good defense down the stretch and we converted our offense pretty good. It was a pretty good overall game." Devin Harris  had 22 points and  Terrence Williams  added 21 and 13 rebounds for the Nets, who finished 655-518 in the Meadowlands. "It's disappointing losing the last game at Izod," Harris said. "But it's been like that for us all season." The Nets (12-69) will play the next two seasons at the Prudential Center in Newark, before moving into a new arena in Brooklyn in 2012. "I hate to see them leave New Jersey," Brown said. The victory was the ninth in 12 games for the Bobcats, who gave starting small forward  Gerald Wallace  the night off so he could rest his bruised left shoulder for the playoffs. Charlotte blew a 15-point halftime lead and had to rally late in the third quarter with Jackson leading a six-point run to go ahead 81-77 heading to the fourth quarter. After the teams exchanged a couple of baskets, Augustin hit a baseline jumper and Henderson, who also had seven rebounds, converted a three-point play to push the lead to 90-81. Tyson Chandler  added a free throw and Thomas made two more to stretch the advantage to 93-81 and New Jersey never got close again. Trailing by 15 at the half, the Nets opened the third quarter with an 18-5 spurt and eventually took a 74-73 lead rebound follow by  Yi Jianlian  with 3:16 left in the quarter. Jackson then sandwiched a jumper and a strong driving layup around a basket by  Boris Diaw  to give Charlotte a 79-74 lead. Harris had 12 of the Nets' 33 points in the quarter in which coach Kiki Vandeweghe played his starters almost the entire period. Game notes  Henderson had two highlight-reel plays late in the second quarter with a dunk over Harris and a reverse play with a pump fake. ... Thomas returned to the Bobcats' lineup after missing three games with a dislocated right thumb. ... Nets reserve F  Kris Humphries  injured his right elbow in the first half and did not return. ... Backup point guard  Keyon Dooling  was inactive with a groin injury, while starting small forward  Jarvis Hayes  missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... The teams split four games this season.
