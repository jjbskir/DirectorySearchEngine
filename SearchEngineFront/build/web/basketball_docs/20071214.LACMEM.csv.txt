MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- With a significant injury list, the  Los Angeles Clippers  are depending on  Chris Kaman  and  Corey Maggette  to take up the offensive slack. The pair took care of their duties Friday night. Both Kaman and Maggette scored 23 points and Kaman grabbed 16 rebounds, while the Clippers used a 10-2 fourth-quarter run to beat the  Memphis Grizzlies  98-91. "Me and Chris are kind of like a one-two combo, and we have to try and keep it going," Maggette said. "We need everyone because injuries are really hurting this team." Cuttino Mobley  scored 17 points and handed out six assists for the Clippers, who sent Memphis to its season-high sixth straight loss. The Grizzlies were stymied by a franchise-record stretch of 10:38 in the second half where they did not connect on a field goal and managed only nine free throws. Memphis committed 25 turnovers. "Obviously, a sloppy game," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "We were just trying to do too much, whether you call it careless or forcing it in there. We are playing in clumps. We are throwing some really strange passes." But the Grizzlies were still behind just 72-70 in the early stages of the fourth quarter, when Los Angeles went on its 10-2 run, and Memphis never got closer than five in the closing minutes. "They're kind of like us," Kaman said. "They're fighting for air. ... I felt like they let off a bit in the second half, so I started going at them." Mike Miller  scored 23 points to lead Memphis, while  Hakim Warrick  added 20 and  Rudy Gay  12. The Grizzlies played without leading rebounder and second-leading scorer  Pau Gasol , who jammed his right big toe in practice on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Clippers still were without  Elton Brand ,  Sam Cassell  and  Shaun Livingston , and  Tim Thomas  left the game in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle and did not return. Those injuries have left much of the offensive load to Kaman and Maggette. Los Angeles led 46-44 after a sloppy first half with Maggette scoring 14 points and Kaman 12. Warrick was 7-of-11 from the field and had 18 points in the half. The Grizzlies did a terrible job of protecting the ball from the start, averaging almost a turnover a minute in the first quarter. Twelve of Los Angeles' first 18 points came off Memphis miscues. "Offensively, we were probably moving a little too quick, trying to make plays that were tough plays," said Miller, who contributed to the turnovers with six of his own. But the Clippers could not separate themselves from the Grizzlies by more than nine points in the half because Los Angeles was having its own problems handling the ball, committing 11 turnovers. The teams continued the sloppy play in the third quarter and remained close throughout the period. There were six lead changes and four ties in the quarter, and Los Angeles led 68-66 entering the fourth. Both teams are struggling to get a complete effort on both ends of the floor. "If the offense is going, there's trouble on defense," Warrick said of the Grizzlies' play. "If it's defense, trouble on offense. We start games off fast and can't finish at the end. "There are a lot of inconsistencies. That's why we have the losses. We have to be more consistent." Game notes  The Clippers signed free agent G  Richie Frahm  before Friday's game. Frahm, who has played with the Rockets, Timberwolves, Trail Blazers and SuperSonics, was cut by Phoenix in the preseason. He played at Gonzaga with Clippers teammate  Dan Dickau . ... Gasol had started all 21 games this season. ... Despite the loss -- the Clippers' fourth straight win over the Grizzlies -- Memphis still holds a 25-23 lead in the all-time series. Los Angeles is one of only four teams over which the Grizzlies hold a series edge. The others are the Raptors, Bobcats and Wizards. ... Warrick scored in double figures for the third straight game. The Memphis reserve had reached double figures only twice in the previous 19 games this season. ... Kaman recorded his eighth straight double-double and 18th of the season. ... Miller converted two 4-point plays in the game, one in the second period, and the other in the fourth.
