MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The  Los Angeles Lakers  followed up a victory over the NBA's best team by getting blown out by the worst. Pau Gasol  had 25 points and 13 rebounds,  Mike Miller  scored 14 of his 25 points in a record-setting third quarter, and the  Memphis Grizzlies  beat the Lakers 128-118 on Tuesday night.

 The Grizzlies scored 128 points against the Lakers, including 76 in the second half. That was the most points the Lakers allowed in a non-overtime game since they gave up 130 in Dallas in 1995, and it was the most second-half points they allowed since allowing 80 in 1989 to the Trail Blazers. 
 
A team with Phil Jackson as head coach had allowed that many points in a regulation game only four previous times, most recently in Indiana in 1991, and it was the most second-half points ever against one of the Big Chief's teams. 
 
The Grizzlies only attacked after scoring only 20 points in the first quarter. Their 128 points Tuesday were the most in a non-overtime game by a team that scored no more than 20 in the first frame since 1992, when the Pacers dropped 137 on the Hawks after scoring only 20 in the first period.

 The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for Los Angeles, which was coming off a 101-98 victory over the  Dallas Mavericks , who have the league's best record. The Grizzlies came into Tuesday's game with the NBA's worst percentage. Lakers coach Phil Jackson had warned his team not to let down against the lowly Grizzlies, who have a rejuvenated offense and are 3-3 under interim coach Tony Barone. "We outplay the better teams right now, but we're getting outplayed by the teams that aren't as good," Lakers forward  Luke Walton  said. "Sometimes, we just end up winning at the end, but this is too good of a league and too long of a season to get a high playoff seed if we keep playing like that." Memphis, which had seven players in double figures, built the lead in the third period, outscoring the Lakers 46-22, including 13 unanswered points over a three-minute span. The 46 points was a Grizzlies franchise record for points in a quarter. "Well, sometimes when things go wrong, it's infectious," Jackson said. "It's tough when you win three of four quarters, and you still lose the game." Memphis led by as many as 24 in the fourth as starters  Kobe Bryant , who led the Lakers with 25 points,  Brian Cook  and  Smush Parker  sat on the Los Angeles bench for the final period. "We didn't execute offensively, which created a bad defensive balance for us," Bryant said of the third period. "They were able to get out on the break and get easy opportunities and blow the game open. "When we did execute, we got easy opportunities that we just didn't make. You add that to the fact that they had so many points in the paint (54), and so many fast-break points (39), and that's tough." Maurice Evans  scored 13 of his 21 points in the fourth as the reserves made a dent in the lead, but they never could get it under double digits. Damon Stoudamire  had 16 points and six assists for Memphis, while  Chucky Atkins  finished with 12.  Rudy Gay  had 11 points, while  Hakim Warrick  and  Alexander Johnson  scored 10 apiece, Johnson grabbing 10 rebounds. Sasha Vujacic  scored 18 for Los Angeles, while  Jordan Farmar  had 12.  Andrew Bynum  added 11 points. Despite a slow start, the Grizzlies eventually got their running style in gear, matching a franchise record with 39 fast-break points, while the Lakers managed only 10 points off the break. Memphis switched to a zone at times, and that helped get the running game going. "I don't know that we played a great zone, but what it allowed us to do was get the ball out and run. I was absolutely thrilled with the tempo," Barone said. The Lakers led 57-52 at halftime as Bryant had 16 points. Gasol scored 13 for the Grizzlies. Memphis was rotating defenders on Bryant, even giving rookie Tarence Kinsey a shot. Kinsey was beaten badly by the league's fourth-leading scorer late in the first half on a spin move down the lane that resulted in a dunk. The half was sloppy, with both teams shooting poorly and committing double-digit turnovers, 10 for the Lakers and a dozen for Memphis. Memphis opened the second half with a 17-7 run, capped by back-to-back 3-pointers by Miller with about seven minutes left in the period. The Grizzlies extended the lead to 85-68 after 13 unanswered points. "We got out there and we ran and executed and ran the offense," Miller said. "That's the whole key. We weren't just doing our freelance, we were actually executing an offense even though it didn't look like it." Miller's scoring and the Lakers' drought helped Memphis open a 98-79 at the end of the third. While Bryant talked about execution problems, Walton pointed to mental mistakes and trying to maintain the same intensity no matter who Los Angeles is playing. "We've shown we have the talent and the ability to play as an elite team," Walton said. "If you have that capability and you have that talent, it's got to be something else. "We've got to be a mentally strong team and come in, be more focused and take care of business, and not think we're going to get wins when we play against teams with losing records."
