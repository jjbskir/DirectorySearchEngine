MINNEAPOLIS -- In a matchup of All-Stars, it was the Timberwolves' supporting cast that made the difference. Kevin Garnett  had 26 points and 17 rebounds Sunday in leading Minnesota to a 98-94 victory over the  Washington Wizards  that ended a three-game slide.
 Elias Says Arenas  Gilbert Arenas made only 4 of 22 field-goal attempts in the Wizards' 98-94 loss to the Timberwolves. It was the 15th time this season that Arenas missed at least 15 shots from the field to give him sole possession of the league lead in that category with one more than Tracy McGrady. Arenas had only 16 such games during the entire 2005-06 season.  Read more  Elias Says . Fellow All-Star  Gilbert Arenas  finished with 20 for the Wizards, but was harried into shooting 4-for-22 from the field. He had averaged 39 points in three games since the All-Star break. Garnett got help from  Ricky Davis , who scored 27 points, and  Randy Foye , who had 13 points and eight assists. The Timberwolves beat Washington at home for the seventh straight season. "I should expect that from those guys," Garnett said. "Doing it on a consistent basis, that's the challenge." Arenas went 11-for-12 from the foul line and  DeShawn Stevenson  scored 21 for Washington, which lost its second straight. The Wizards played without All-Star forward  Caron Butler , who missed the game with back spasms. He is second on the team in points (20.3) and rebounds (7.6) per game.  Jarvis Hayes  got the start and finished 1-for-10.  Andray Blatche , the Wizards' other starting forward, was 3-for-10 from the field. "They just said, 'Hey. We will just let those guys shoot and we will load up on Gil," said Washington coach Eddie Jordan, who doesn't know Butler's status for Tuesday's game in New Jersey. Minnesota coach Randy Wittman was pleased with the way his team adjusted to shut down Arenas, after the guard scored 38 in a 112-100 win over the Timberwolves on Tuesday. "That game we gave him too many wide angles to the basket, where there was nobody to impede," he said. "Tonight we did a good a job as we've done in terms of clogging the lane." Davis spent much of the night guarding Arenas, but he wasn't the only one to slow down the so-called "Agent Zero." "(Foye) took him, Mike (James) took him, we had all four or five guys there challenging him and making him take tough shots and he finishes 4-of-22," Davis said. "Somebody had a hand in his face at all times." Even so, Arenas' 3-pointer got the Wizards within five points midway through the fourth, and a three-point play by  Brendan Haywood  got Washington within three points 2 minutes later. Jumpers by Garnett and Foye, and a free throw by Davis pushed the lead back to eight with 2:47 to play. Foye hit a jumper for a seven-point Minnesota lead, but Arenas' reverse layup was good on a goaltend. After an offensive foul on Minnesota, Stevenson hit a 3-pointer with 47.4 seconds remaining to make it 95-93. Davis rebounded a Garnett miss with 27.7 seconds to play to keep the ball from Washington.  Mark Blount  missed two free throws, but Garnett grabbed the rebound, and Foye subsequently made two free throws with 13.1 seconds left. "If we would have got a rebound at the end, it might be a different outcome. Maybe they wouldn't have cut our hot water off," Arenas said. Washington players had to take cold showers after the game. This came one day after the Wizards' flight from Chicago was diverted to Duluth, Minn., and they had to bus approximately 160 miles to Minneapolis. Tied at 60, Minnesota closed out the third quarter on a 17-6 run, including six apiece by Davis and Garnett, who had 13 points and five rebounds in the quarter. Davis, who scored 24 Tuesday, ended the period with a three-quarter-court pass to Foye for an easy dunk. "I though Ricky was aggressive on both ends all night," Wittman said. Down 36-29, Davis scored 11 points during an 18-3 Minnesota run, and Garnett had the other seven, for a 47-39 lead with 1:18 to play in the half. The win was a confidence boost for the Timberwolves, who are two games into a four-game stretch against division leaders. "We needed this because we've got the best team in the league (Dallas) coming in Tuesday," Foye said. Utah is scheduled to visit Friday.
