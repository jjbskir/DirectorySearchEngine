 James LeBron James scored 32 points in Cleveland's 109-99 win over Milwaukee. It was James' 100th career 30-point game, coming one day before his 22nd birthday. James is the youngest player in NBA history at the time of his 100th career 30-point game, breaking the "record" held by Bob McAdoo, who did it at age 23 years, 170 days in March 1975.

 Marshall scored a season-high 29 points -- 21 on 3-pointers -- and
 LeBron James  scored 32 in his final game as a 21-year-old, leading
the  Cleveland Cavaliers  to a 109-99 win over Milwaukee and snapping
the Bucks' six-game winning streak Friday night. Larry Hughes  emerged from a shooting slump with 26 points for
the Cavaliers, who blew most of a 21-point lead in the second half
before hanging on to win their seventh in a row at home against
Milwaukee. Marshall, who had scored just 13 points combined in his previous
five games, felt during warmups that he might have a breakout
performance. "I went out before the game and shot the ball well," the
12-year veteran said. "Myself and  David Wesley  always play a
shooting game, and he's been killing me. I got him today. I think
that carried over into the game." Marshall dropped three 3-pointers in the final 8:11 as Cleveland
improved to 13-3 at home. "That's what happens when a guy like Donyell gets it going,"
said James, who eclipsed 30 points for the 100th time in his career
on the eve of his 22nd birthday. Michael Redd  led Milwaukee with 24 points,  Mo Williams  had 21
and  Ruben Patterson  added 17 and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, who
made it 93-89 on Williams' free throw with 4:15 left. But Marshall, who set the NBA record with 12 3-pointers for
Toronto in 2005, drilled a 3-pointer, James scored inside and
Hughes hit a layup to make it 100-91 with 3:02 remaining. After a
basket by Redd, Marshall made another 3 and James scored on a drive
before draining Cleveland's 11th 3-pointer to give the Cavaliers a
109-97 lead with 1:01 left. Bucks coach Terry Stotts warned his team about Marshall's
ability to hit from deep. "I have a lot of respect for Donyell's versatility as a 3-point
shooter," he said. "We probably didn't get to him as quickly as
we should have." Marshall scored 13 points in the second quarter and matched his
season high by halftime, helping the Cavaliers take a 60-40 lead at
the break. Trailing 71-50 and without big man  Brian Skinner  -- who got
tossed in the third for a hard foul on James -- the Bucks outscored
the Cavs 13-2 in the final 3:58 of the period to make it 79-71
entering the fourth. The Cavaliers, too, were in foul trouble, as  Zydrunas Ilgauskas 
and  Drew Gooden  picked up their fifth personals in the first minute
of the final period. With  Anderson Varejao  sidelined with a
strained neck, Cavs coach Mike Brown was forced to play Dwayne
Jones for the first time this season. Williams' 3-pointer got Milwaukee to 89-86 with 6:14 left, but
the trio of James, Marshall and Hughes made sure Cleveland held on
as the Cavs enter a stretch in which they'll play 10 of their next
12 on the road. "Give Cleveland credit," Redd said. "Marshall made some big
threes. We really couldn't solve that, and LeBron hit some big
threes." Marshall came in averaging 7.3 points, and he had reached double
digits six times before making all seven field-goal attempts,
including four 3-pointers, in the first 24 minutes. His third 3-pointer of the second quarter was long, but after
hitting the back of the rim, it bounced high in the air and twice
on the cylinder before dropping through. "That's when I felt it was going to be a good night," he said. Skinner was ejected early in the third quarter for wrapping his
arms high around James, who was sent tumbling into the basket
stanchion. "The initial foul wasn't bad, but then he threw me down,"
James said. "It didn't hurt. I'm a football player." Stotts didn't think Skinner's foul was excessive. "From my angle, it looked like he tried to hold him up," he
said. "They (officials) said he came through and threw him down. I
thought it was a hard foul, a flagrant foul, but not a flagrant
two." Hughes entered in a horrible shooting funk, making just 25 of 77
shots in his previous five games. But he went 3-for-4 in the first
quarter, and the Cavaliers shot 60 percent from the field while
opening a 34-19 lead. Game notes Nike has concocted a bet between James and tennis star
Maria Sharapova. The winner will be the one who logs the most
running miles in January. The loser has to be a ball/water boy -- or
girl -- at the other's sporting event. "I need to tell Coach I need
to play a little more to get my miles in," James joked. ...
Williams is one of three players averaging 17 points, five rebounds
and five assists. James and  Kobe Bryant  are the others. ... The
Cavs are an NBA-best 24-3 at home since March 5.
