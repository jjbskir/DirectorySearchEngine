OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The New Orleans Hornets turned to their
bench to put away the defending NBA champions in the fourth
quarter.

 Wade The only starter to score in double figures for the Heat in their loss was Dwyane Wade (29). He also earned that distinction in Miami's record-setting 108-66 opening-night loss to the Bulls. The Heat had only two such games -- that is, with no more than one starter scoring in double-figures -- over the two previous seasons combined.

 Bobby Jackson ,  Rasual Butler  and the Hornets' reserves opened
the final period with a 10-point run to back a 23-point performance
from  Peja Stojakovic  in a 101-86 victory Tuesday night over the
 Miami Heat . "As subs, we know what we've got to do when we step on that
court. That's to hold it down and make sure we play and don't give
up any leads and make sure they don't get any leads. We do a great
job of that," Jackson said. "Sometimes we may get careless, but the majority of times we're
going to come in and play our roles and make things happen." Jackson converted a three-point play off a floating finger roll
down the left baseline to cap the spurt and give New Orleans an
85-71 lead. Stojakovic, who won New Orleans' last game with a last-second
3-pointer Saturday at Minnesota, stretched the lead to 15 with a
3-pointer near the top of the key. The Heat never got closer than
11 after that, and Miami coach Pat Riley pulled his starters with
3:17 left and the Hornets up 16. "The bench was outstanding," said Hornets guard  Chris Paul ,
who had 11 points and 10 assists for his sixth double-double.
"They came in and really pushed the lead out for us. That's what
we needed." Dwyane Wade  had 29 points for Miami, and  Jason Williams  added
13. The Hornets had six players in double figures:  Desmond Mason  had
17, Bobby Jackson scored 14,  Marc Jackson  added 12 in his first
start of the season and Butler scored 10.  Tyson Chandler  added 18
rebounds, two off the Hornets' franchise record. "That's what's special about our team," Paul said. "Some
nights a guy may have 30 or 40, but we're at our best when the
scoring is balanced and everyone contributes." The Heat shot 19 percent in the fourth quarter in their first
game since  Shaquille O'Neal  had surgery on his left knee. He's
expected to miss four to six weeks and wasn't with the team for the
trip to Oklahoma City. "We know we've got to stick together, that's the main thing,"
Wade said. "We've been going through the ups, we've been through
the downs. The one thing we didn't do last year is we never pointed
the finger at each other. We know how it works, but we've got to
get it going. ... We're a couple men down, but we've got to always
stick together." Besides Wade, the rest of Miami's starters combined to score 24
points.  Antoine Walker  fouled out and  Alonzo Mourning  was ejected
in the fourth quarter after an altercation with Marc Jackson. "He's got to do a better job of getting off the ball quicker at
times, and then other guys when he gets off it, they've got to do
something with it," Riley said of Wade. "We talk about it, we
work on it in practice all the time, but tonight in the fourth
quarter we were missing all our shots." New Orleans pulled ahead in the third quarter with a 16-6 run
that started when Mason answered Wade's cutting layup with a
baseline drive for a three-point play. Stojakovic added a 3-pointer
and a fast-break layup and Chandler had a steal for a fast-break
layup before  Cedric Simmons  made it 70-61 by making one of two free
throws. Williams hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions to lead the
Heat back, and his fast-break basket on a goaltend by Simmons
brought the Heat within 75-71 after three quarters. But that's when the Heat went cold, missing nine straight shots
to open the fourth quarter as the Hornets gained some distance. "I'm not sure we're that good. We're a pretty good basketball
team, but we've still got a long ways to go. They're missing a big,
giant key to that team, that being Shaquille O'Neal," Hornets
coach Byron Scott said. "When he's out, it changes the whole
dynamic of their team and it puts a lot of pressure on Wade. "I'm sure when Shaq gets back ... they'll start playing like
the champions they are." New Orleans led 15-6 after an early nine-point run and trailed
for only one possession in the first half despite shooting only 33
percent. They were up 47-46 at halftime. Game notes Scott said he lingered after shootaround to meet with
Riley. Scott was on Riley's NBA championship teams with the Los
Angeles Lakers in 1985, 1987 and 1988. "He's somebody that's going
to always be big in my life, as a player and obviously as a
coach," Scott said. ... Marc Jackson started in place of David
West, who missed his fourth straight game with a strained right
forearm. ... The crowd of 19,329 was the second-largest ever for a
Hornets game at the Ford Center.
