SALT LAKE CITY -- Playing with five fouls,  Mehmet Okur  had to be careful on defense for most of the fourth quarter. On offense, he came through again and led the  Utah Jazz  to their first sweep of the  Chicago Bulls  in five years. Okur scored 12 of Utah's final 14 points in a 100-95 victory over the Bulls on Monday, making the Jazz 3-1 since they lost leading scorer and rebounder  Carlos Boozer  for up to a month. It was Utah's third straight victory and Okur has led the Jazz in scoring each time. "I missed a few shots earlier, but my teammates have confidence in my shot so they kept giving it to me," Okur said. Okur, who was honored as Western Conference player of the week earlier in the day, finished with 20 points, scoring 15 in the second half. Deron Williams  had 18 points and 13 assists, and  Derek Fisher  scored 19 points for the Jazz, including two free throws with 7.7 seconds left for Utah's only points down the stretch that didn't come from Okur. "We know he can make shots. That's why if we can, we try to get him the ball," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said of Okur. Kirk Hinrich  led Chicago with 26 points and  Luol Deng  added 23 for the Bulls, who couldn't capitalize on a huge advantage from the free throw line. Chicago took 47 free throws to Utah's 31, but the Bulls missed 10 times from the line and couldn't stop Okur at the end. "In my mind, he's definitely one of the most clutch players in the league," said  Ben Gordon , who scored 11 for Chicago. "As a team, we've just got to keep the ball out of his hands in those situations." Matt Harpring  added 13 points and  Gordan Giricek  scored 12 for the Jazz. Chris Duhon  scored 14 and  P.J. Brown  added 10 points for the Bulls, who fell to 2-2 on their seven-game road trip and were swept by the Jazz for the first time since 2002. Hinrich scored 11 in the third quarter, keeping the Bulls in it after Utah went up 63-47 on a shot by Okur. Hinrich made a 3-pointer, then Gordon hit a jumper to cut Utah's lead to 63-52. In the fourth, Utah's foul trouble got worse when Okur was called for his fifth with 8:07 left to play. The Jazz were already without Boozer, and  Andrei Kirilenko  went to the locker room with an ice pack on his back midway through the period. But after a few minutes on the bench, Sloan had to take his chances with Okur's foul situation. Okur hit a 22-footer with 3:33 left to play, starting his 12-point run. "He's being unbelievable this year," Harpring said. "I know he's rolling and hopefully we can just keep giving him the ball." Duhon made back-to-back 3-pointers for the Bulls and the second got Chicago within 93-80 with 1:19 left in the game. Williams brought the ball back up for Utah and once he stepped inside the arc, he passed it right back out to Okur, who hit from 26 feet to put Utah back up by six. "You have to have players who have the ability to get someone the ball," Sloan said. "They switch on (Williams) and Memo has a smaller guy on him. That's the way basketball is. You gamble on one thing and something else comes up." Okur followed his big 3 with another shot that bounced off the rim and in with 26 seconds left to just about seal it.
