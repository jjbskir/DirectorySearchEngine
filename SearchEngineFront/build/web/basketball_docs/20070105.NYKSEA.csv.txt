SEATTLE (AP) --  Eddy Curry 's humble apology was the catalyst for
a nearly perfect performance by the bulky New York center. After getting benched following an early technical foul, Curry
responded by making all nine of his shots, bullying Seattle's
frontcourt for 27 points and leading the Knicks to a 111-93 rout of
the SuperSonics on Friday night. Curry picked up his technical for arguing with referee Bob
Delaney less than 3 minutes in. After a couple of minutes to cool
off on the bench, Curry apologized to Delaney, then proceeded to
score 15 points in the final 5 minutes of the first quarter. "I apologized to him, he accepted my apology and I just got
onto a roll," Curry said. He wasn't alone, with  Stephon Marbury  scoring 28 points and
 Jamal Crawford  adding 22. The Knicks were chuckling about this one
by halftime and laughing hysterically in the final minutes as fans
in the emptying arena chanted "We want Jerome!" for New York's
 Jerome James , a former Sonic. Coach Isiah Thomas looked down the bench to see if James wanted
to enter, but he was content to watch. The Knicks never trailed
against Seattle and won the final two games of their five-game West
Coast road swing. "We're starting to play good basketball. I like the way we're
defending. I like the way we're rebounding," Thomas said. "I like
our attitude and our approach." Playing in his hometown, Crawford took 26 shots to get his
points, but scored 17 in the first half. Last season in Seattle,
Crawford scored all 31 of his points in the second half of a Knicks
victory. New York didn't need such heroics on Friday, not with Seattle
unable to slow Curry or keep the Knicks -- the NBA's top rebounding
team -- off the boards. Curry was 7-for-7 shooting in the first
half, with his only miscues a pair of missed free throws. Curry
shot over the shorter  Danny Fortson  or simply used his girth to
bully skinnier  Johan Petro  and  Nick Collison  for easy baskets in
the lane. "There just wasn't enough bodies," Seattle coach Bob Hill
said. Curry made both of his shots in the second half, and added six
rebounds. He also scored 27 points in the Knicks' win at Portland
on Wednesday night. "I'm just trying to go out there and attack right away," Curry
said. "Try to go at them right away so they know they're going to
have a problem the whole game." When Seattle sent an extra defender to help on the inside, Curry
showed improved passing out of the double teams. Crawford and
Marbury knocked down perimeter jumpers, combining for seven
3-pointers in the first half. Marbury's consecutive 3-pointers at the end of the third and
start of the fourth gave the Knicks a 26-point lead. Marbury shot
9-of-17, hitting five 3-pointers.  David Lee  added 10 points and 10
rebounds off the bench as New York outrebounded Seattle 41-34. But Thomas was more impressed with Marbury's defense. Thomas put
Marbury on Seattle's  Ray Allen , and Marbury was part of a constant
double-team every time the All-Star touched the ball, forcing
someone else to hit shots. "Marbury was great on defense. It was one of the best defensive
games I've ever seen him play," Thomas said. "He went out and
guarded him and played extremely hard and then he had a good
offensive game going, too." Allen finished with 11 points, shooting just 3-of-10, but no one
took the scoring load for the slumping Sonics. The loudest cheers
from the near-sellout crowd were reserved for a 5-year-old
breakdancer who took the floor in the fourth quarter. "You've got to step up and knock down a couple of shots and
make them pay for doubling," Allen said. Chris Wilcox  led Seattle with 13 points.  Damien Wilkins  added 12
but shot only 4-of-16. Seattle lost its third straight and has
dropped 11 of 14 overall. Reserve guard  Earl Watson  scored 12. Seattle went 2-of-14 on 3-pointers. Game notes The Knicks' 36 first-quarter points and 68 first-half
points were both season highs. ... Seattle signed F Andre Brown to
a 10-day contract. Brown leads the NBA Developmental League in
scoring at 22.8 points and is second in rebounding at 10.8 playing
for Sioux Falls. ... Knicks F  Quentin Richardson  missed his 11th
straight game with back spasms.
