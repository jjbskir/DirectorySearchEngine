SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah's defense went from uninspired to impenetrable. The Jazz held Milwaukee to two field goals in the fourth quarter while rallying to beat the Bucks 98-87 Monday night. After shooting 57 percent through the first three quarters, the Bucks were 2-for-18 in the fourth and went the first 7:25 of the period without a field goal. Deron Williams  scored 14 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and had 10 assists for the Jazz in their fourth straight victory. He made 16 of 20 free throws, including eight in the final period. "I was just trying to be aggressive. When the lane opens up that much, you've got to take it," Williams said. Carlos Boozer  added 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Jazz, who outscored the Bucks 27-15 in the fourth. The Jazz also limited former University of Utah All-American  Andrew Bogut  to three points in the fourth quarter as the Bucks fizzled. Bogut had 23 points and 10 rebounds in his return to Salt Lake City and former Jazz guard  Mo Williams  scored 21. "We got the same shots we got throughout the game. We just didn't make them," Mo Williams said. The Bucks jarred Deron Williams with several picks that knocked him to the court and some hard fouls when he drove to the basket. Williams left the game briefly in the third quarter, then came back looking angry and determined to not let the Jazz be Milwaukee's sixth road win this season. His teammates caught on quickly and the Bucks could not crack Utah's defense. "Our D creates our offense," Boozer said. "We got tipped balls, got the loose balls. If we play D like that, we're mostly successful and we usually win games." Utah is on its longest streak since winning five straight in early November. Paul Millsap  scored 11 for the Jazz, who rallied after Deron Williams' 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter started a 10-0 run. Williams opened the fourth with a jump shot and Utah started playing defense and flustering the Bucks. "He made some great plays," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. Michael Redd 's two free throws with 6:58 were Milwaukee's only points of the fourth until Redd added two more from the line with 5:01 left. Mo Williams' 3-pointer with 4:35 was Milwaukee's first field goal of the period and got the Bucks within 86-79, but the Jazz held on easily from there. Milwaukee went 0-3 on a Western Conference road trip and coach Larry Krystkowiak said one quarter cost the Bucks each game. "On the road, you've got to be solid," Krystkowiak said. "We got some good looks I thought, but didn't make shots." Redd finished with 16 points. Bogut's hook shot was on target through the first three quarters and he had the Bucks outplaying the Jazz. The 7-footer had the assist of the night when he dribbled up the court and bounced a pass behind his back to Mo Williams, who hit a 3-pointer to put the Bucks up 62-59. Bogut followed that with a layup, then went right over Boozer for a one-handed dunk that put the Bucks up 66-61. But Deron Williams got the Jazz rolling again on his 3-pointer just before the end of the third, starting Utah's 10-0 run. The Bucks only had six free throws in the first three quarter and finished with 18 -- 25 fewer than Utah. "We're not going to win many games when a team shoots that many more free throws," Bogut said. Game notes  The Bucks outrebounded the Jazz 11-6 in the first quarter. ...
