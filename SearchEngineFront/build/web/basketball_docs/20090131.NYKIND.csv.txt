 Harrington, who began the season with Golden State and came to New York on Nov. 21 in a trade for  Jamal Crawford , is averaging 20.5 points and 6.3 rebounds since joining the Knicks and their up-tempo offense. "This is the perfect style of play for me," Harrington said. "I'm having a lot of fun and I haven't had fun in a while." Harrington was happy to be reunited with Donnie Walsh, the former Pacers president who drafted him with the 25th pick of the 1998 NBA draft. Walsh, now the Knicks president, was in attendance Saturday. "I wanted to win the game for him, just to put a smile on his face," Harrington said. "Being around Donnie lets me feel super comfortable, feel like I can do anything." David Lee  finished with 23 points and 17 rebounds, reserve  Wilson Chandler  had 16 points and eight rebounds, and  Quentin Richardson  scored 15 for the Knicks, who have won three straight and six of seven. New York (21-25) moved within two games of matching its win total from last season. "I'm pleased with the way we're playing and the group we have because they're really trying," first-year Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We won't look back, we'll look forward. We want to make the playoffs, we've said that all along." T.J. Ford  had a career-high 36 points,  Danny Granger  scored 19 and  Mike Dunleavy  and  Stephen Graham  each chipped in 14 for the Pacers. Indiana had its seven-game home winning streak snapped. "We got out of the gate slow and could never get the game in our control," Ford said. "We were not even close." New York pushed a six-point first-quarter lead to 19 in the second. After the Pacers took a 33-30 advantage on Granger's 3-pointer early in the period, the Knicks went on a 25-5 run to open a commanding 55-38 edge. Richardson's 3-pointer pushed the lead to 63-44. The Knicks shot 57 percent from the field in the second quarter and nailed eight of 11 3-point attempts. "They just shot the heck out of it," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. New York maintained a double-digit lead for most of the third quarter before Granger's three-point play cut the deficit to nine with 3 minutes left in the period. The Knicks built the lead back to 14, and took a 99-87 edge into the final quarter. The Pacers made it 116-109 on Ford's layup with 54 seconds left. The Knicks answered with Harrington's dunk, and  Chris Duhon 's two free throws extended the lead to 121-111. "I'm just happy we got the win," Harrington said. "That's always the sweetest revenge when you can come in and win the game verses your old team." Game notes  Knicks C  Jared Jeffries  suffered a left thigh bruise in the first quarter and did not return. ... The Pacers finished January 7-1 at home. They were trying for their first 8-0 month since Feb. 2000. ... D'Antoni didn't have a problem with Granger making the All-Star team as a reserve over Lee. "There's a little bit of lag time on guys. David has a little bit of a lag time. Danny has done it for two years," D'Antoni said before Saturday's game. Granger was the 17th pick in the 2005 NBA draft and Lee was the 30th.
