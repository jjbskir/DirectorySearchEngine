NEW YORK (AP) -- The large contingent of flag-waving, chanting Spaniards who roared for  Juan Carlos Navarro  gave this the feel of an Olympic game. More importantly for the  Memphis Grizzlies , it seemed more like a home game than a road one. Maybe that's why they won. Mike Miller  scored 24 of his season-high 34 points in the first half, and the Grizzlies snapped an 18-game road losing streak Friday night with a 120-106 victory over the  New York Knicks . "It felt like a home game, as much as they were cheering for him," Grizzlies forward  Rudy Gay  said of Navarro. "He's the mayor out here." Gay added 24 points for the Grizzlies, who stormed to a 19-point halftime lead, blew it all before the end of the third quarter, then pulled away again for their first win outside Memphis since beating Indiana on Jan. 2. Miller was scoreless in the third quarter, then had 10 in the fourth to help the Grizzlies improve to 4-18 since trading  Pau Gasol  and end a stretch of 79 days between road victories. "It's good to get the monkey off our back," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "Obviously it was a problem with our self confidence on the road. Guys came out to play. We had a bad third quarter again, but this time guys righted the ship." Navarro finished with 17 points, leaving to a loud ovation in the final minutes as Miller held the rookie's arm up in the air. "I was happy to see that for Juan because he came a long ways over here and then Pau left and he's all by himself," Miller said. "Came from Spain to help us win games, and to see his fans come out here like this when we came to New York, I'm just happy to see him get a win and happy to see him play well." Jamal Crawford , the only member of New York's preferred starting lineup who played, scored 22 points.  Nate Robinson  had 18 and rookie  Wilson Chandler  17 for the Knicks (19-49), who have lost three straight, 10 of 11, and matched their loss total from all of last season. Though speculation and common sense make it hard to believe he's part of it, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas is thinking of the team's future, so he benched  Zach Randolph  so he could start  Randolph Morris  along with Chandler. Thomas said he plans to do the same thing Saturday at Minnesota -- another team the Knicks are competing with for better draft position. "This is definitely a growing and a learning experience for me and this is a very tough time," said Thomas, who spent most of the week answering questions about the Knicks' potential desire to replace him as president. "But you try to grow and learn from the tough times also." Miller opened and Navarro closed a 14-0 spurt with 3-pointers late in the second quarter as Memphis turned a two-point game into a 58-42 lead. Miller nailed three more 3-pointers before the break as the Grizzlies took a 69-50 lead after their highest-scoring first half of the season. The Grizzlies seemed to get a boost from the group among the sellout crowd of 19,763 who chanted "Carlos!" after some jumpers by Navarro, who helped Spain win the 2006 world championship. Fans even started doing the wave during a timeout late in the first half. "I know that in New York there's a lot of Spanish people," Navarro said. "It was like my first time in the Garden. I'm really, really excited. It gave me energy. I'm really happy to bring these people this game." The Knicks returned from the locker room and scored the first 18 points. New York eventually tied it at 90 on  Mardy Collins ' steal and dunk with 33 seconds left, but  Kyle Lowry  made two free throws 20 seconds later to send Memphis to the final period with a two-point lead. Hakim Warrick  and Miller converted consecutive three-point plays in the fourth as Memphis pushed the lead back up to 19. Warrick had 11 points and 10 rebounds.
