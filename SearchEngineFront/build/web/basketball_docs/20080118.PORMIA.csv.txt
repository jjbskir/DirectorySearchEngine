MIAMI (AP) --  Dwyane Wade  took an alley-oop feed and sank an acrobatic layup. He hit a 3-pointer. He scored and scored, and the crowd roared, and a third-quarter surge left the  Miami Heat  on the verge of their first victory in nearly a month. Then came another collapse. Brandon Roy  led a fourth-quarter comeback by the  Portland Trail Blazers , who won 98-91 Friday to extend the Heat's losing streak to 12 games, matching the third-longest in franchise history. Wade finished with 37 points and helped Miami score 35 in the third period to take a seven-point lead. It wasn't enough. "That was the best third quarter we've played in probably two years around here," Wade said. "We thought that was the turning point, but it wasn't." Wade managed only two points in the final period, when he went 1-for-7, including a miss that would have tied the game with less than 2 minutes left. Roy finished with 24 points to help the Trail Blazers win for the ninth time after trailing at the start of the final period. "They really brought it to us in the third quarter, especially Dwyane," Roy said. "We took it as a challenge to come out in the fourth quarter and show them we get tough when things get down." Wade tied his own franchise record by scoring 17 consecutive Heat points, and he set a team record for points in a third quarter with 20 to help Miami take a 76-69 lead to start the fourth quarter. Roy answered with 16 in the final period, including nine during a 14-0 run that put Portland ahead 88-78. Miami managed only one field goal in the first 7 1/2 minutes of the fourth period. "We just couldn't sustain what we did in the third quarter," Heat coach Pat Riley said. "That was as well as we played in a long time from a defensive standpoint. Then in the fourth quarter we just began to miss shots." The disappointed crowd included members of the inaugural Miami team in 1988-89, which won 15 games.  Grant Long , a forward for the expansion Heat, said they would match up competitively with the current club. "People might say this team would steamroll us, but I don't think so," Long said. Mired in their longest losing streak since late 2001, the Heat are on pace to win 17 games. They last won on Dec. 22, and their 8-30 record is the worst in the Eastern Conference. "Everybody is down," said  Shaquille O'Neal , who had 20 points and 11 rebounds. "Everybody is humiliated and embarrassed. But I've seen people in worse situations. We've got to keep fighting, and hopefully it will turn around." The Blazers regained sole possession of first place in the Northwest Division, a half-game ahead of Denver, and improved to 7-12 on the road. They're 17-3 at home. After Miami's  Jason Williams  sank a 3-pointer with 2:01 left to cut Portland's lead to 90-88, the Heat forced a turnover. But  Udonis Haslem  and Wade missed shots, and  Travis Outlaw  sank a jumper for Portland, before  James Jones  hit a clinching 3-pointer. "We had control of the game, and then we took a punch from them in the third quarter," said Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan, whose team is the youngest in the NBA. "We were able to recover and win the game. That is part of the growth that we are starting to see." Outlaw finished with 18 points for the Blazers. They made 25 of 31 free throws and had 10 more rebounds than the Heat, despite a strong effort by O'Neal. Making only his second start after missing eight games with a hip injury, O'Neal dominated early, scoring eight of the Heat's first 10 points to help them lead 12-6. "I'm glad to see the big fellow back, and us working the ball down to him," Wade said. "Hopefully we can get him even more involved, because he's looking pretty good." The Blazers surged ahead before Wade took charge to cut an 11-point Portland advantage to 58-55. After a three-point play by Miami's  Ricky Davis  tied the score, O'Neal twice missed inside but grabbed the rebound both times and sank his third try for a 71-69 lead. "I'm feeling pretty good," O'Neal said. "Guys are getting it to me in a spot where I can do something with it. ... "We've just got to learn how to win again." Game notes  The 1988-89 Heat team was honored at halftime as part of the franchise's 20th-season celebration. ... New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez sat courtside next to Heat owner Micky Arison. NBA Hall of Famer Bill Russell was also in attendance. ...
