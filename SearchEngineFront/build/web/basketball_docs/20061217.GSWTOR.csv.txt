TORONTO (AP) -- A scary back injury to backup Raptors' guard Jose
Calderon overshadowed Toronto's third straight victory without
 Chris Bosh . Morris Peterson  had 23 points and  T.J. Ford  added 21 points and
14 assists to lead the Raptors to a 120-115 win Sunday over the
 Golden State Warriors . Calderon, Toronto's backup point guard, was removed from the
court on a stretcher and placed in a neck brace after injuring his
lower back on a rebound. He was hurt with 32 seconds left, while
blocking out Golden State's  Mickael Pietrus . The game was delayed
for several minutes as Calderon was motionless on the floor. The
Raptors said he was being taken to a hospital for testing. "He does have movement in all his limbs," Toronto spokesman
Jim LaBumbard said. LaBumbard said the 25-year-old player was smiling and gave a
thumbs-up. "He's in good spirits," he said. Tests revealed he sustained a bruise to his left lower back, the
team said later in a statement. He is listed as day-to-day, and did
not accompany the team on its flight to Phoenix after the game. Calderon helped lead to Spain to a gold medal at the world
championships in September. He is 6.4 points and 3.1 assists. Spanish teammate  Jorge Garbajosa  went with Calderon to the
hospital. "I think all the players are a little shook after what happened
to  Pape Sow  this summer," Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said,
referring to a fractured vertebrae that the Toronto forward
suffered last summer. "Jose means a lot to us. Right now,
basketball is secondary to Jose. We just hope he's OK." Sow, who is sidelined for the season after neck surgery, was
hurt driving to the basket preparing for the Las Vegas Summer
League. His neck struck a player's leg as he went down. Sow prayed from the bench as Calderon was down. "I was praying that what happened to me, not happen to him
because I know how hard it was," Sow said. "Thank God he's
talking and moving. I couldn't do that when it first happened to
me. I'm very glad he's moving." Calderon's injury also brought back bad memories for Ford, who
suffered a spinal-cord injury in 2004 that sidelined him for a
season and a half. "I remember the incident, but the feeling I had I block it out
of my mind," Ford said. Andrea Bargnani  had 18 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks for
the Raptors, who had six players reach double figures while
improving to 3-2 without Bosh, their leading scorer, who has an
injured left knee. Monta Ellis  scored 28 points and  Baron Davis  had 20 for the
Warriors, who are on a six-game road trip. Golden State's  Keith McLeod  called Calderon's injury scary. "It was unfortunate that it had to happen. It was good that he
was conscious and everything, but it is a very unfortunate
situation and I wish him the best," McLeod said. Peterson had 14 points in the second half. He also had nine
rebounds and three assists and finished 9-for-15 from the field. Peterson's layup and consecutive 3-pointers gave Toronto a 95-90
lead late in the third quarter. Golden State closed within four in
the final minutes of the game, but Ford made several free throws
down the stretch to seal the victory. Bargnani, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, had the first
double-double of his career. The Italian forward has improved in
recent weeks while being given more playing time. Game notes The Warriors play their next six games against Eastern
