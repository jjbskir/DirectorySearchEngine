PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Atlanta's trouble with the Trail Blazers
has ended for now. Joe Johnson  had 33 points and the Hawks beat the Blazers 107-96
Sunday night, snapping a nine-game losing streak to Portland. The Hawks had not won at the Rose Garden since Dec. 15, 1997.
The nine-game losing streak dated to 2002. "To come into their house, it was big," Johnson said. Salim Stoudamire , a Portland native, hit a 3-pointer to put the
Hawks up 87-70 in the third quarter for their biggest lead of the
game. Zach Randolph 's hook shot for the Blazers narrowed it to 94-87
in the fourth, but  Tyronn Lue  hit two straight jumpers to put the
Hawks up 101-88 and the fans at the Rose Garden booed the home team
before streaming out. The victory snapped Atlanta's three-game road losing streak. "They were making some shots, but we came right back and
countered them, that's a big thing on the road," Johnson said.
"When they make a run you gotta make one right back. We played our
hearts out tonight. We showed up tonight and got a big victory." The Hawks play Tuesday at Seattle, the second game of their
five-game trip. After opening 4-2, the Blazers have lost five straight and 10 of
12, including a 91-89 defeat to visiting Orlando on Friday night. Randolph had 30 points for the Trail Blazers. Rookie Sergio
Rodriguez added 11 assists off the bench. "For a month we were scrapping and doing some things," Blazers
coach Nate McMillan said. "And now, as young guys, I think we're
searching." Atlanta's  Josh Smith  left Friday's 106-95 loss at home to
Cleveland after he was poked in the eye. Hawks coach Mike Woodson
listed Smith as day-to-day, but he started Sunday wearing
protective eyewear and had 13 points and 12 rebounds. Lue, who finished with 19 points, was full of praise for
Johnson. "He's great. He can shoot the 3, post up, shoot off the
dribble, handle it, pass, pick and roll, and defend," Lue said.
"He's one of the top five two-guards in this league. He's carrying
this team." The Blazers started  Travis Outlaw  instead of struggling guard
 Martell Webster . Outlaw quickly picked up two fouls and Webster
came in to get 15 first-half points. It was Webster's 20th birthday and he looked determined to get
his starting job back. He finished with a season-high 18 points. The Blazers struggled defensively. "Defensively, the coach says it's up to the players. We need to
dig down and make some defensive stops," Blazers guard Jarrett
Jack said. "He sees it in glimpses, like earlier in the season. We
need to get back to doing that." Stoudamire hit a 3-pointer to put Atlanta up 40-32, but Webster
answered with a 3-pointer for Portland. Johnson came back with
another 3 for the Hawks, before Rodriguez hit a 3-pointer for the
Blazers to narrow it to 43-38. The Hawks led 60-52 at the half. The tough times are here," McMillan said.  Game notes Portland rookie  Brandon Roy  has shown improvement and will
begin low-impact rehabilitation of his heel injury. He will not
make the team's upcoming road trip and will be reevaluated upon the
team's return. ... The Blazers open a season-high six-game road
trip with a matchup against Detroit on Tuesday. ... Hawks coach
Mike Woodson had never defeated the Blazers.
