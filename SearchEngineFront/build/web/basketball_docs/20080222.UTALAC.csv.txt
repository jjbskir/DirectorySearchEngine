LOS ANGELES (AP) --  Elton Brand , who hasn't played all season because of a ruptured Achilles tendon, wants to return as quickly as possible. One reason is that he's itching to play with talented rookie  Al Thornton . Thornton scored 14 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and the Clippers shocked the surging  Utah Jazz  114-104 on Friday night, giving them back-to-back wins for the first time in 3 1/2 months. "Whatever Al does on the court, I expect it because he works so hard and he challenges himself every day -- in games and in practice,"  Corey Maggette  said of the Clippers' first-round draft pick. "The past couple of months he's been more patient. He can hit fadeaway shots, but now he's picking and choosing when to attack the basket more. "Would he ever been in this position if Elton Brand wasn't hurt? You never know. But when guys go down, that gives another guy an opportunity to step up. And he's really been stepping up and seizing that opportunity." At the moment, Brand is still going through his paces in non-contact drills, but still hasn't been cleared to go through a full practice and all the banging that goes with it. "The next hurdle to overcome with me is just getting back the confidence with my left leg, jumping off the leg and getting my balance," Brand said. "I mean, you can do so much cardio and drill work, but getting in the court is entirely different." Brand said he expects to be cleared for full practice in a week or two, and hopes to be playing soon after that, even if it's limited minutes. With the Clippers 14 games under .500 and 13 games out of a playoff spot, why not shut it down the rest of the season, start fresh in training camp and not risk another injury with the team headed toward another draft lottery? "No matter how much time is left in the season, if I'm healthy, I'm going to play because this is my job," Brand said. "I want to jell with Al Thornton. This kid is a great young player, and I haven't played a lick with him.  Chris Kaman  has been an animal on the boards, and I have to see how many boards I can steal from him." Maggette scored 27 and Kaman added 14 points and nine rebounds. This was the 14th attempt they've made at consecutive victories since starting out 4-0. "I'm glad it happened," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "Now we have to go for three in a row. Utah has been playing great basketball, but our guys played for the whole 48 minutes." Deron Williams  had 26 points and 10 assists for the Northwest Division-leading Jazz. All-Star forward  Carlos Boozer  had 22 points and 10 rebounds. Utah was outscored 38-26 at the free-throw line and committed 16 turnovers, which the Clippers converted into 21 points. Los Angeles outscored Utah 58-38 in the paint. The Jazz also were also 0-for-13 from 3-point range, matching their worst effort of the season. "We took a lot of 3-point shots, thinking we were going to get going, and we lost confidence in our offense because we never had much. But they had a lot to do with it," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "They were terrific. They took us on like you're supposed to, and they were a lot more physical." Seventeen of Utah's 20 losses this season have come on the road. The Jazz came into Staples Center on a 17-2 roll that began with reserve forward  Kyle Korver 's first game with Utah, following the Dec. 29 trade that sent disgruntled  Gordan Giricek  to Philadelphia. "It's not the end of the world. It all depends on how they react after a loss," Sloan said. "It's a long, drawn-out season, and hopefully they learn something from it." The Clippers broke open a close game with an 11-0 run that extended the margin to 72-57 with 7:31 left in the third quarter. Maggette and  Tim Thomas  triggered the rally with 3-pointers 29 seconds apart. Game notes  Utah's recent surge included two wins over the Clippers. ... Utah has had a double-digit assist performance from one of their players in 19 of the last 20 games. The Clippers haven't had one in almost a year.  Shaun Livingston  had 14 against Golden State last Feb. 24. But in the next game, he sustained a dislocated left kneecap that required reconstructive surgery on March 13. He hasn't played since.
