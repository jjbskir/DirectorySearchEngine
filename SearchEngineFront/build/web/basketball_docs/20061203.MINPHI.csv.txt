PHILADELPHIA (AP) --  Ricky Davis  couldn't shut up the few
courtside Philly fans gesturing and yapping at him in the fourth
quarter. His clutch baskets and some sharp 3-point shooting from
 Mike James  was more than enough to quiet the skidding 76ers. Davis scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and Kevin
Garnett had 15 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Minnesota
Timberwolves to a 95-84 win over Philadelphia on Sunday night. "When someone comes up and plays big in the fourth, that's what
we need," Davis said. The Timberwolves had a pair of players leading the
fourth-quarter charge to stop a three-game losing streak. James and
Davis combined to lead the Timberwolves' push, turning into a
potent 1-2 punch that knocked out the Sixers in front of a sparse
home crowd and dreary atmosphere. James made three 3-pointers in the quarter and teamed with Davis
to score 23 of Minnesota's 27 points, helping the Timberwolves get
a road win for only the third time in nine games. James finished
with 20 points. Allen Iverson , fined last week for skipping a bowling event, led
the Sixers with 26 points.  Samuel Dalembert  had 15 points and nine
rebounds, and  Chris Webber  11 points and nine rebounds. The Sixers
have lost four straight and 11 of 13 since starting the season 3-0
for the first time since the 2000-01 season. That year ended with an Eastern Conference title for
Philadelphia. This one might land them in the lottery. "I don't have any answers for what's going on," Iverson said.
"We're not having no fun out there on the basketball court. That
has a lot to do with losing." This time, it was Davis' turn to extend Philadelphia's misery. When Davis wasn't jawing with taunting front-row fans, he was
knocking down baskets from all over the court to boost Minnesota's
lead early in the fourth. He opened the quarter with an 18-footer,
hit his first 3-pointer of the game, and sank two free throws for a
75-67 lead. Davis enjoyed the give-and-take with the Philly faithful. "Yeah, it was nice," he said. "It got me going a little bit
and I appreciate it." When Davis converted a three-point play late in the fourth he
gave the Timberwolves something to really appreciate -- their first
double-digit lead, 83-73. James added two of his 3s late in the quarter to provide some
cushion and Minnesota shot 52 percent overall from the floor. "I shoot hundreds of those shots every day and I put the work
in, so it's only right when I come into the game that I shoot with
confidence," James said. The Timberwolves outrebounded the Sixers by eight and became the
latest team to exploit Philadelphia's woeful defense. Iverson and Garnett carried their teams for most of the first
three quarters in a tight game where neither team could build a
lead larger than six points. Davis sank an 18-footer in the final
minute of the third to help put the Timberwolves ahead entering the
fourth. "We knew come the fourth we wanted to make a bigger push, take
the lead and be aggressive," Garnett said. Minnesota did all three, and left the Sixers wondering what they
can do to win. "This is not the way it was supposed to be," coach Maurice
Cheeks said. "It's not what I envisioned. Our effort on the floor
tonight wasn't good enough. We're still searching for an answer." Game Notes Philadelphia F  Kyle Korver  sat out his second straight game
