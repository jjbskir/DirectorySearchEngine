MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A second half burst and a stronger defensive effort sent the  Portland Trail Blazers  off to a good start on their five-game road trip. Brandon Roy  scored 20 points,  LaMarcus Aldridge  added 16 points and 12 rebounds, and the Trail Blazers won their third straight with a 93-79 victory over the  Memphis Grizzlies  on Tuesday night. "This means a lot for us as far as momentum goes, and as far as chemistry goes," Aldridge said of starting a stretch where Portland plays five games in seven days. "I think we did a great job of making our chemistry better." Steve Blake  and  Greg Oden  had 14 points each for Portland, all of Oden's coming in the second half. Marc Gasol  led Memphis with 20 points, while  O.J. Mayo  scored 17. The Grizzlies, who dropped their sixth straight, still were without guard  Allen Iverson , who left the team last weekend, with owner Michael Heisley's blessing, after playing three games on the West Coast. Memphis center  Hasheem Thabeet , the No. 2 overall pick in last year's draft, suffered a fractured jaw late in the first quarter when he collided with the head of teammate  Zach Randolph  (11 points, 12 rebounds). The Trail Blazers have now won eight straight in the series. Portland broke open the game with a 14-1 run in the third period erasing a Memphis lead. The Grizzlies never really threatened after Portland rebuilt the lead to double digits on Oden's dunk with 10 minutes left in the game. Oden, who was in foul trouble in the first half, made a difference after intermission. "I was only in there about 4 minutes," Oden said of the first half, "so there wasn't enough time for me to establish myself. I think guys kept looking for me, and I'm thankful for that." Randolph's layup with 13.6 seconds left in the half tied the game at 45. Neither team held a lead of more than 6 in the half. There were seven ties and 13 lead changes before the break. Aldridge had 12 points to lead the Trail Blazers, while Roy had 10 at intermission. The pair was a combined 9-of-11 from the field. Gasol had 12 points for Memphis. Portland eventually put together the 14-1 rally, extending the Trail Blazers lead to 67-55, their largest advantage of the game at that point. Memphis was struggling from the field, hitting only four of its first 16 shots in the quarter. "We just had an awful stretch," Memphis coach Lionel Hollins said. "Four turnovers, a missed shot and then a couple of breakdowns defensively. We just lose our concentration and focus for that short period of time, and the next thing you know, we're down 10 points." The Grizzlies were able to whittle away at the lead, and Gasol's 3-point play with 6.3 seconds left in the third quarter, cut the Portland advantage to 69-61 entering the fourth. Memphis made only 31 percent of its shots in the second half, committed seven turnovers and allowed Portland to run successfully. "In the second half, we held them to 34 points, and were able to get out and get some easy baskets," Portland coach Nate McMillan said. "In the first half, we had zero fastbreak points. In the second half, we ended up with 10." Game notes  Memphis last defeated Portland on March 29, 2007. ...
