 Kidd Jason Kidd's 80th career triple-double was unlike any of his first 79. It was only the third time in NBA history that a player had exactly 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a game. Penny Hardaway did it for the Suns in April 2003, as did Andre Iguodala for the 76ers in March 2005. For more Elias Says,  click here 
 
 
 Carter scored 36 points, Kidd registered his 80th career triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists and three reserves made big fourth-quarter contributions to lead the Nets to a 108-95 victory over the Bucks on Wednesday night. "Jason and Vince obviously played at a very high level but they couldn't have won the game alone," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "The contribution of the bench speaks for itself." Marcus Williams  had six points and an assist in the fourth quarter. Fellow rookie  Hassan Adams  added six points, two steals and three assists with the game on the line and backup center  Mikki Moore  had five points and four rebounds as the Nets won consecutive games for only the third time this season. "Everybody, I think, contributed," said Carter, who was 12-of-23 from the field with six 3-pointers. "Once you get your swagger and mojo going, it works wonders for you. Those guys came in and gave us energy." Charlie Villanueva  scored 23 points and  Mo Williams  added 17 for the Bucks, who couldn't overcome the combination of a slow start and Redd's worst game since April 15, 2005. The NBA's No. 3 scorer (28.9) had a season-low nine points, snapping a streak of 101 games in which had scored in double figures. "You just have to realize that you are going to have a lot more great games than you have bad games," said Redd, who was 3-of-13 from the field. "Tonight New Jersey was determined to shut me down. They did a good job. They had an extra body in front of me all night." Redd's previous low this season was 15 against Toronto on Nov. 3. His last sub double-digit game was eight against Detroit at the end of the 2004-05 season. Andrew Bogut , who didn't score in an earlier meeting between the teams this season, added 15 points and 11 rebounds for Milwaukee. Milwaukee, which trailed by 12 points in the opening minutes, pulled within 79-77 on a 3-pointer by  Steve Blake  in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. After a turnover by Marcus Williams, the Bucks lost a chance to tie the game when  Ruben Patterson  (16 points) turned the ball over. The Nets then took over. Williams hit a 3-pointer, Moore slammed home a missed floater by Adams, and Adams then made a reverse layup off a nice pass from Carter for an 86-77 lead. After Redd missed another shot, Carter hit two free throws for an 88-77 lead and Milwaukee never threatened again. "I though Hassan came in and changed the game around, defensively and offensively," Kidd said. "We could feed off the energy he came with. Vince was Vince and we can talk all night about what he did but I thought Hassan was the turning point." Carter, who hit his first five 3-pointers on Monday, hit his first four in the opening quarter to help New Jersey take a 25-13 lead. "Give him credit, he buried all four of them," said Redd, who had two points and three fouls in the first half. "I knew once he hit those four, as a fellow scorer, once you get that rhythm, it's going to be a long night for the opposing team." The Nets hit 10 of their first 12 shots from the field, but made only six of 26 the rest of the half in taking a 50-47 lead.

The triple-double was the second straight and third in four games for Kidd.
