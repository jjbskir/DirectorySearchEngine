 In an important win over Utah, Duncan scored 14 points and grabbed nine rebounds. It's a mediocre outing by his standards but enough to help the Spurs get a big 105-99 victory over the fading Jazz on Friday night. Tony Parker  scored 31 points, and the Spurs shook off their recent funk long enough to bury the Jazz further back in the playoff picture. Both teams are in, but Utah lost for the fifth time in six games to inch closer to facing the dominant  Los Angeles Lakers  in the first round. Utah has three games left to climb out of the No. 8 seed and move into a more favorable matchup. The Spurs, who have won only three of their last seven, also have three games to try and secure home-court advantage for at least one series. "Every one is very important right now," Duncan said. "But more than that, getting our confidence up and getting a rhythm going." Sore knees have hounded Duncan since the All-Star break, and it's been apparent on the court. He scored a season-low four points Wednesday in a loss against Portland, and was pulled in the fourth quarter after lumbering awkwardly toward a loose ball. After that game, Parker said many don't realize that Duncan has been "playing on one leg for like a month and a half."

Deron Williams  had 25 points and 10 assists for the Jazz, whose misery in San Antonio continues. The Jazz haven't won here since 1999, a streak spanning 20 games. The loss dropped Utah into sole possession of the bottom seed in the West, a game behind New Orleans and Dallas. "We put ourselves in this position. Nobody else did," Williams said.
