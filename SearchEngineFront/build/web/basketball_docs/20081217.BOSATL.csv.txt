Garnett scored 10 of his 18 points in the final quarter, and Atlanta's  Joe Johnson  missed a late free throw that would have tied it, helping the Celtics beat the Hawks 88-85 on Wednesday night for their 16th straight victory. After Johnson missed the second of two free throws with 2.7 seconds,  Ray Allen  made a pair of free throws with 0.7 seconds left for the defending NBA champion Celtics, who have a franchise-best 24-2 record. It was only the second loss in 10 home games for the Hawks. "I told KG to take us home down the stretch," Celtics guard  Rajon Rondo  said. "I said make something happen. He said no problem."

Garnett, quiet for much of the game, was 5-for-5 from the field in the fourth quarter after opening 2-for-10. "It means we're playing well. We want to play championship basketball. That's what we're building up to. Our goal is to win a champion-
ship," said Garnett. "You play your role around here. You do your job. You do what you're supposed to," he said. "We got a lot of great shots within the last few minutes of the game. Kevin hit two unbelievable shots," said Boston coach  Doc Rivers . In the only other game this season between the two, the Celtics beat Atlanta 103-102 on Nov. 12 in Boston on  Paul Pierce 's last-second basket. Pierce added 18 points, and Allen had 16 for the Celtics. The Celtics are 10-1 on the road and 14-1 at home. "Sometimes it seems as though it's a burden. That monkey grows. It's a good monkey though," Allen said. "I've never been on a streak like this. It's great to be a part of our winning here. I think our winning is based on our preparation." Johnson led Atlanta with 20 points, 10 in the final period. He was 7-of-7 from the line before the miss.  Marvin Williams  added 16 points, and  Josh Smith  and  Mike Bibby  had 14 each for the Hawks. "I had a chance to get us into overtime and missed the second free throw. I made the first one and some of the pressure was off," Johnson said. "We drew the play up, and Joe got to the line, and the player that has carried this team the last four years went to the line," said Atlanta coach Mike Woodson. "You could not ask for anything different." The Celtics took the lead for good at 85-84 on Garnett's basket with 30.8 seconds left. Rondo, who had 15 points, then made one of two free throws to make it 86-84 lead with 9.1 seconds left.
