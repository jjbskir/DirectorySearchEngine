TORONTO (AP) -- The  Indiana Pacers  are making a bad habit of falling apart in the second half. Chris Bosh  scored 22 points,  Jose Calderon  added 15 points and 10 assists and the  Toronto Raptors  beat the Pacers 110-101 on Friday night, handing Indiana its sixth straight defeat. The Pacers have blown halftime leads in four of those losses. "I don't know what it is," Indiana's  Jamaal Tinsley  said. "I've been here seven years and it seems like the same thing. It's frustrating when you go out there and play good for one half and in the second half, you lay an egg. We've got to get together some way, somehow. It's getting frustrating. You get tired of hearing the same old thing." Anthony Parker  and  T.J. Ford  each scored 15 points as Toronto ended a three-game home losing streak.  Jason Kapono  scored 12 points and  Carlos Delfino  had 11. Tinsley said the Raptors were "more determined" in the second half. Toronto shot 50 percent after the break. "They hit some unbelievable shots," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "They just opened the court and were able to knock down a lot of challenged threes." The Raptors, who never lost more than two straight home games last season, were pleased to end their minislump. "We feel like we got a little monkey off our backs," rookie  Jamario Moon  said. Tinsley and  Troy Murphy  each scored 20 points for the Pacers (3-6), who have not won since a road victory over Memphis on Nov. 3. Bosh made just 5-of-15 field-goal attempts but connected on 12-of-13 from the free-throw line. Despite another poor shooting night, Bosh isn't losing confidence. "When they start going in, it's going to be trouble for a lot of people," he said. A jumper by Tinsley and free throws by Tinsley and  Jeff Foster  cut Toronto's lead to 101-98 with 1:07 left, but Calderon responded with a 3-pointer with 48 seconds remaining that pushed Toronto's lead back to six. "I don't think they lost the game, I think we won it," Calderon said. "We played really good defense in the fourth quarter." Jermaine O'Neal  scored 14 points for Indiana. O'Brien credited Toronto with trapping O'Neal in the low post and said his team didn't do enough with the open looks those traps created. "We need to knock down shots when he's trapped," O'Brien said. "We didn't do that on a consistent basis and God knows we had enough open looks." Indiana led 56-53 at the half, but the Raptors opened the third quarter with a 13-4 run, capped by a three-point play by Ford that gave them a 67-60 lead with 6:47 remaining. Tinsley replied with a pair of 3-pointers sandwiched around another basket by Ford to pull the Pacers back. Parker ended the third with a 70-footer, giving Toronto an 81-74 edge. Indiana's  Danny Granger  was called for a flagrant foul on Moon with 4:50 to go in the third, knocking Moon down as the Toronto rookie went up for a dunk. Moon crashed into the pads at the base of the basket and came up clutching his right ankle but remained in the game. Indiana outrebounded Toronto 47-35.
