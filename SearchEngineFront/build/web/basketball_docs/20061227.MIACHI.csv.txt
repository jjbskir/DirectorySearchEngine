 Gordon Ben Gordon scored 40 points off the bench in the Bulls' 109-103 win over the Heat. Over the last four seasons, the only other players to score at least 40 points in a game they didn't start were Darius Miles (47 for the Trail Blazers, April 19, 2005) and Mike Miller (41 for the Grizzlies, March 17, 2006).

 Andres Nocioni  added 16 for Chicago, which recovered after blowing a 20-point lead. The Bulls have won 14 of 17 overall and are 12-3 in December. The Heat played most of the game without Wade, who injured his right wrist midway through the first. It appeared he got hurt coming off a screen while covering  Kirk Hinrich . Miami coach Pat Riley blamed Hinrich for Wade's injury. "Hinrich pulled his hand. Hinrich grabbed his hand, which he does all of the time," Riley said. "That's what he does anytime Dwyane comes off screens. They always either grab his shirt or hand. It's a little bit of a tactic down below the body. The officials can't see it. So he had Dwyane's hand and tried to pull it out of there." Wade initially stayed in the game, but came out after the next timeout. He went to the locker room for X-rays, which were negative, and didn't return. He was to have an MRI on Thursday. Wade had an injury to his right wrist this summer. "It felt like my wrist got pulled out of place. It's pretty painful. It feels like it got yanked out of the socket. I don't have any strength in it. I knew I was done," said Wade, who left the arena with his wrist wrapped. Wade, from suburban Chicago, has had very little luck back home. He came in averaging just 13.8 points in six regular-season games at the United Center. Gordon didn't appreciate Riley's comments after the game, especially since Heat forward  James Posey  was ejected for taking down  Luol Deng  from behind in the fourth quarter. "I heard him saying something about Kirk. Posey's was way more blatant. I don't think Kirk did anything. He was just playing aggressive defense. Kirk didn't do anything dirty. I don't appreciate him taking shots at our guys," Gordon said. Posey also knocked down Hinrich in the playoffs last season and was suspended for one game. Chicago, coming off a two-point loss in Minnesota on Tuesday night, took a 97-96 lead when  Ben Wallace  hit a free throw with 2:49 left. After Wallace missed two foul shots badly, he stole a pass and found Gordon for a layup to make it 99-96. Udonis Haslem  came back for Miami with a tip, and  Jason Williams  hit a jumper to give the Heat a 100-99 lead with 1:26 left. Then, Gordon and the Bulls finally took control. Gordon, off balance and hit hard in the lane, converted a three-point play for a 102-100 lead.  Jason Kapono  missed a long 3-pointer and  Tyrus Thomas  was fouled on the other end. He made two free throws to make it 104-100 with 24.5 seconds left. "We're confident. I think in the past, we would've lost a game like that. It's good to get a win on an ugly game that will help us as the season continues," Gordon said. Williams scored 28 points for Miami, and Kapono had 18.  Dorell Wright  added 17, and Haslem finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Hinrich had 14 points and five assists for Chicago. Wallace added nine points and 11 rebounds. The Heat came all the way back from a 20-point deficit and took an 87-85 lead on Williams' 3-pointer with 7:54 left. Gordon came back with a jumper and Deng had what looked to be an easy dunk for the Bulls, but he was taken down by Posey, who was ejected immediately. Deng stayed in the game after laying on the floor for a few minutes holding his sprained right wrist. He hit one of two free throws to give Chicago an 88-87 lead with 7:16 remaining. Posey was called for a flagrant foul, and Haslem and Hinrich were issued technical fouls for jawing at each other after the play. At first, the Heat looked lost without Wade, who was coming off a dazzling performance against the Lakers on Christmas. Chicago outscored Miami 17-2 to start the second quarter, taking a 41-23 lead. Gordon scored 15 points in the period on 5-of-8 shooting. Miami came back in the third and got within four late in the quarter.  Michael Doleac  hit a jumper and Kapono followed with a 3 to pull to 70-66 with 2:54 left. Early in the fourth,  Chris Quinn  hit a 3 to get the Heat to 80-78. Williams then made three straight 3s, giving the Heat an 87-85 lead with 7:55 to go. Game notes  Deng finished with eight points and 11 rebounds. Thomas had 10 points. ... Chicago outrebounded Miami 45-39.
