 "It was a beautiful win for us, against the NBA champions and on the road makes it even sweeter." Roger Mason  pulled up and leaned into a 3-pointer with 20.4 seconds left to give San Antonio the lead, then hit a pair of free throws after  Manu Ginobili  hit four as the Spurs pulled away from the Celtics.  Tim Duncan  scored 23 points with 13 rebounds and  Matt Bonner  had 23 points -- the second-most in his career -- including 3-of-6 from 3-point range. The Spurs won for the ninth time in 11 games. Ginobili scored 19 points off the bench, playing more than 31 minutes after sitting out Tuesday's game against Denver with a bruised hip. Duncan, who had not missed a game since 2007, also sat out the Nuggets game, as did  Michael Finley  and  Tony Parker  while the Spurs try to pace themselves over an eight-game, three-week road trip.

 "If I would have played in Denver, I wouldn't have been this fresh for sure," Ginobili said. "It was very important for us to get rest a couple of days." Kevin Garnett  scored 26 points with 12 rebounds,  Paul Pierce  had 19 and eight and  Rajon Rondo  had 16 assists for Boston. It was the second loss in three games for the Celtics, who lost to the  Los Angeles Lakers  on Thursday in an NBA Finals rematch to snap a 12-game win streak. Boston embarks on a six-game road trip, interrupted by the All-Star break, before returning home at the end of the month. "We've got a tough task in front of us, going on the road for the next couple of weeks, and we've got to make up some ground," Pierce said. "We have our work cut out for us. This is a big road trip for us." Duncan converted a three-point play to give the Spurs a 90-87 lead before  Ray Allen 's basket cut it to one point and Garnett hit a pair of jumpers to give Boston a 93-90 lead with 1:36 to play. But Bonner hit a jumper from the foul line and Garnett missed, then Mason hit his 3 to make it 95-93. The Celtics were inbounding the ball when Ginobili stole the pass and drew a clear-path foul, giving him two shots and the Spurs the ball. San Antonio extended its lead to 101-93 before  Eddie House  and Garnett hit 3-pointers to help cut the deficit to three points. The Spurs scored the last five points of the first half to open a 60-52 lead, but the Celtics opened the second with 12 straight points to retake the lead.
