AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Will Bynum  couldn't wait for his first NBA start. He was ready when he got his chance. Bynum, pressed into the starting lineup five hours before the game, scored a career-high 22 points and matched his career-best six assists Friday night to help the short-handed Pistons end a three-game losing streak with a 108-90 victory over the  Los Angeles Clippers . Antonio McDyess  had 24 points and 17 rebounds and  Tayshaun Prince  added 23 points and a career-high 12 assists to help Detroit win despite using just eight players for most of the night. "The pace of the game was great for us," said Bynum, who got the start after flu-like symptoms sidelined  Rodney Stuckey . "I just tried to be aggressive. I knew I was the only point guard tonight." His energy helped the Pistons, who took the floor without four of their top five scorers as Stuckey joined  Richard Hamilton  (groin),  Rasheed Wallace  (calf) and  Allen Iverson  (back) on the bench. Bynum had his fourth straight double-digit scoring night and helped draw Los Angeles' defenders away from the Pistons' big men in the second half. "Will did a great job pushing the ball up the floor," said  Kwame Brown , who scored 14 points -- his best output as a Piston. "It allowed me and 'Dyess to get open shots." Rookie  Eric Gordon  scored 22 points and  Baron Davis  added 19 and eight assists for the Clippers, who have lost 13 straight against the Pistons. Detroit trailed by 12 points in the first half and was down 50-46 at intermission but Prince scored the last five of a 9-1 spurt early in the third quarter that gave the Pistons the lead for good. The Clippers helped by turning the ball over three times in the period. "We got more sound defensively," Detroit coach  Michael Curry  said. "When we're doing the things we should be doing defensively, we can be pretty good." Los Angeles pulled to 79-77 early in the fourth quarter but  Walter Herrmann  answered with a pair of 3-pointers in a 27-second span to give the Pistons a cushion. Herrmann scored all 13 of his points in the last 9 minutes of the game for Detroit, which was 13-for-18 from the field in the final period. "At one point when we had a 10-point lead we should have had a 20-point lead," Los Angeles coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "Our bigs didn't control the paint like they should have and gave up too many easy buckets around the basket." Chris Kaman  had 13 points and  Marcus Camby  added a dozen for the Clippers, who last defeated Detroit on Nov. 3, 2002. Game notes  The Clippers were without guards  Ricky Davis  (knee) and  Mardy Collins  (foot). ... Hamilton missed his third straight game and Wallace was out for a sixth consecutive night. ... Bynum's previous scoring high -- 19 points -- came Tuesday at Dallas.
