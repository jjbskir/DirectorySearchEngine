SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A night after being blown out by 28 points, the  Sacramento Kings  were happy to get a win -- no matter how ugly it looked. Kevin Martin  scored 32 points and had eight rebounds to help the Kings rebound for a 106-100 victory over the struggling  Toronto Raptors . Ron Artest  added 19 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and four steals for the Kings, who won for the third time in four games despite 22 turnovers that led to 22 Toronto points. "It wasn't textbook, but the guys came up with a victory," Kings coach Reggie Theus said. "We did what we had to do down the stretch." Scoreless through three quarters,  Carlos Delfino  hit a 3-pointer and then made two free throws, pulling Toronto within one point with 2:59 remaining. The Kings, who lost 127-99 to Phoenix on Saturday, went on a 6-0 run. Artest made a tough fallaway jumper, Martin connected on a corner jumper and  Brad Miller  converted two free throws to put Sacramento ahead 98-91 with 1:35 left. Two jumpers by  Jason Kapono  brought the Raptors to within three points twice in the final 23 seconds, but Martin made three free throws and Artest made a layup off an inbounds pass with 10.9 seconds left to put the Kings ahead 104-98. Kapono scored 26 points off the bench for the Raptors, who have lost four straight and five of six.  Rasho Nesterovic  added 20 points and eight rebounds for Toronto. "We've got to get five, six, seven players playing well at the same time," Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said. "One night, it's a couple of guys. The next night, it's a couple of different guys. We need a few more people playing better." Mikki Moore  scored 17 and had seven rebounds for the Kings.  Beno Udrih  had 15 points and seven assists, while Miller contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds. The Raptors played their ninth straight game without All-Star forward  Chris Bosh , the team's leading scorer and rebounder, who's out with a sore right knee. Toronto is 2-7 during the stretch without Bosh and 4-10 overall this season without him. "He is an All-Star, their best player, so that had a lot to do with the win tonight," said Artest, who said he had forgotten the Kings' 25-point loss in Toronto when Bosh had scored 31 points. The turnovers were prevalent all game for the Kings, who had 15 by halftime, many of them unforced. However, capitalizing on Toronto's small lineup at times, the Kings had a 50-35 rebounding edge. "It was a bad night there, that's way too many turnovers," said Udrih, who had six of them. "So the rebounding really helped us a lot." The Kings led 32-23 after one quarter and their fast start offensively was hardly surprising considering Toronto's recent defense. The Raptors had allowed their previous five opponents to shoot 54 percent or better and were coming off a humiliating 137-105 loss Friday in Denver, allowing the fourth-most points in franchise history. It was the 10th straight loss at Arco Arena for the Raptors, who haven't left the building with a victory since March 13, 1997. Toronto is 0-4 on its current road trip, which concludes Monday night in Utah. "We've got to come out [against the Jazz] with a sense of urgency," Kapono said. "We've got to get back on track because it's playoff time. We can't go splitting games or going two or three games. We have to go in with the mind-set that we can win all five games." Martin ignited the Kings early in the third quarter with a pair of 3-pointers during a 10-0 run. He scored 13 points in the third to help Sacramento take a 75-73 lead into the final period. Udrih scored 12 points and both Artest and Moore had 11 in the opening half for the Kings, who led by as many as 13. Led by the shooting of Kapono, who scored 16 points, the Raptors went on a 15-2 run and trailed 53-49 at the half. Game notes  Geoff Petrie, the Kings' vice president of basketball operations, was scouting the SEC tournament at the Georgia Dome when the tornado hit Friday. ... Nesterovic and Kapono took nearly half of Toronto's 47 first-half shots. ... Kings rookie  Spencer Hawes  suffered a strained left foot against Phoenix and played only four minutes against the Raptors, while  John Salmons  missed the whole game with a sore ankle. Both are expected to play Tuesday against Golden State. ... The Raptors shot four free throws through three quarters and finished 8-of-13.
