 Orlando has won eight of its last nine games and six in a row on the road. Howard toyed with four Washington defenders -- scoring 14 points and grabbing nine rebounds in the first 8:45 as the Magic took a 25-11 lead. "Our thing is we have to come out strong and let teams know how the game is going to be played the whole night," Howard said. "We've got to be able to do that every night to be a great team. Look at the teams like the Celtics and the Lakers, they come out the first quarter and they dominate and set the tone. We have to continue to do that in order to be one of those teams." JaVale McGee  started at center for Washington, and he picked up two fouls in 2:16.  Andray Blatche  was the next to try to stop Howard, and he had two fouls in 1:47. By then, Howard had seven points. Etan Thomas  was the third to guard Howard, who scored seven more points as the Magic went on an 11-0 run to take that 14-point lead. "He was obviously the dominant guy in the first half," Orlando coach Stan Van Gundy said. "Getting off to a good start was also important." Howard went to the bench moments later, and Washington, which has dropped 11 of its 13 games this season, went on a 19-3 run to cut it to 38-34 early in the second quarter. Only  Darius Songaila  had a modicum of success against him. Playing against Howard was a frustrating experience for Wizards interim coach Ed Tapscott. "He takes up a lot of space," Tapscott said. "It's like a quarter-mile around his shoulders, he's so broad." Caron Butler  scored 19 of his 25 points in the first half for Washington, and  Antawn Jamison  had 17 points and 12 rebounds. Orlando had just three points in the first 6:57 of the second quarter after scoring 38 points in the first quarter -- the most allowed by Washington this season. The Wizards played their second game under Tapscott after beating Golden State by 24 points in the first. Tapscott, who replaced Eddie Jordan on Monday, said he'd had time to add a few of his own innovations to the offense. He suggested that Butler and Jamison would play on the same side of the court more often, and also warned that there probably wouldn't be a repeat of Tuesday night's romp. "That was a one-of-a-kind game," Tapscott said. After McGee hit a layup to start the quarter to cut Orlando's lead to nine at 55-46, the Magic went on a 16-3 tear to make it 71-49 lead with 6:57 to play in the third quarter. Hedo Turkoglu  added 20 points and had a season-high 10 rebounds. He clearly admires his 6-foot-11, 265-pound teammate. "He's huge. He's really helping for all of us for playing better because it's so hard to guard him one-on-one out there," Turkoglu said. "It opens up for other guys when they double team and he's a good passer, too." Butler could only stand and watch his teammates flail against Howard. "No one in the league has matched up well against him except Houston," Butler said. "He's a handful. He's a guy who can pound you down there." Rashard Lewis , who gave Orlando a victory Wednesday night in Philadelphia with a late 3-pointer, added 17 points, and Mickael Peitrus also had 17.  Anthony Johnson  had a season-high 12 assists. While the Magic had a comfortable Thanksgiving, their coach did not. Stan Van Gundy said that he was feeling sick, and didn't join the team for its pregame holiday meal. "I did the stuff to get ready for the game, took a nap. Happy Thanksgiving," Van Gundy said. Game notes  Blatche, who had 25 points against Golden State, had five as he fouled out in just 13 minutes. ... Orlando is the only NBA team that will play on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve. ... The Magic were without G  Jameer Nelson  (strained right hip flexor). He's expected to miss at least a week. ... Orlando's  Keith Bogans  missed his third game because of a fractured right thumb. ... Washington G  Antonio Daniels  returned after missing five of the previous six games because of a sore right knee. Tapscott said Daniels approached him and volunteered to come off the bench to allow  Dee Brown  to start.
