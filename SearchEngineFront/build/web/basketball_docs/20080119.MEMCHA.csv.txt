CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- It has taken a few games, but  Jason Richardson  and  Gerald Wallace  have figured out their roles as the  Charlotte Bobcats ' main scoring threats. That, coupled with the Bobcats' newfound intensity on defense, proved to be a combination that was too much for the  Memphis Grizzlies  to handle. Richardson scored a season-high 38 points and Charlotte held off a fourth-quarter rally to beat Memphis 105-87 on Saturday night. It was the Bobcats' first win over the Grizzlies in team history. "They feed off each other -- either one of them can have a 40-point night," Charlotte coach Sam Vincent said. "I think they've gotten to the point where they're comfortable in their coexistence. They know they're both scorers and they're both going to get shots. I think our nucleus is starting to feel comfortable around them as well." Richardson also equaled his career high with 14 rebounds, and  Emeka Okafor ,  Raymond Felton  and  Matt Carroll  had 11 points apiece for the Bobcats, who have won three of their last four games. "I like the aggressive play that we have and the camaraderie among the team," said Richardson, who was acquired from Golden State in a draft-day trade. "Everybody is starting to understand their roles offensively and defensively. Our defense is a whole lot better, our offense is a whole lot better ... and we're just being more aggressive." Charlotte didn't show the effects of a 112-84 loss to New Orleans on Friday night, shooting 50 percent from the field -- including a team-record 80.9 percent in the third quarter, when the Bobcats went up 80-67. They also forced 16 Memphis turnovers, 11 off steals. "It shows a lot about this team," Wallace said. "We're playing great basketball right now. We had a tough loss yesterday ... but we forgot about it, had a quick turnaround and came out and got a win tonight." Pau Gasol  had 28 points,  Juan Carlos Navarro  added 21 and  Rudy Gay  17 for Memphis, which has lost six of its last seven games and four straight on the road. "Obviously we're grinding away," Grizzlies coach Marc Iavaroni said. "Not to make excuses, but we've got to find guys who are eager to score. ... Our bench didn't give us much, and these are the nights where your bench has to step up." Memphis made things interesting for the Bobcats in the fourth quarter, opening the period with an eight-point run.  Kyle Lowry 's three-point play with 10:21 left cut Charlotte's lead to 75-70. But Wallace drained a 3-pointer and Richardson hit two more 3s during a 15-4 run that put the Bobcats back in control. After swapping the lead six times and tying the score three others in the first five minutes, the Grizzlies took their first substantial lead behind a 9-1 run, going up 20-15 on Gasol's hook shot with 5:07 left. But Wallace scored eight points during a 13-point tear that put Charlotte in command. He opened the run with back-to-back three-point plays to give the Bobcats a 24-20 lead with 3:52 left, then rammed home an alley-oop dunk a minute later to put them up 28-20. Charlotte managed to stretch its lead to 11 points twice in the second quarter -- the last at 40-29 with 4:03 remaining when  Bobby Jones  was called for goaltending on a layup by Wallace -- before Memphis closed to 46-41 at the break. Game notes  Iavaroni had little to say about a published report that the Grizzlies were attempting to buy out the contract of veteran guard  Damon Stoudamire . A source told ESPN.com that team officials were close to an agreement with the 12-year pro, which would then allow him to sign with either the  Boston Celtics  or  Phoenix Suns . "I have not heard that report," Iavaroni said. "That's the first I've heard of it. That would be my comment. That's news to me." ... Memphis guard-forward  Mike Miller , one of the league's top 3-point shooters, was inactive for Saturday's game due to back spasms. Miller is the Grizzlies' No. 3 scorer at 16.5 points per game, and is sixth in the NBA in 3-pointers made and 10th in 3-point percentage. ... Iavaroni said that Memphis will likely resign Jones to a second 10-day contract this week. The second-year forward played in five games since he was signed by Memphis on Jan. 10, and in his first start on Friday had career highs of 20 points and 13 rebounds in a 124-100 win over Seattle.
