 "We defended, we ran, and we got some transition baskets," Paul said. "That's when we are at our best. This is only the second time in my four years in the league that we've beaten Detroit, so I'll take it." David West  added 20 points for the Hornets, who had six players in double figures.  Tyson Chandler  finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds, winning the praise of New Orleans coach  Byron Scott . "I really thought he was the catalyst," Scott said. "He hit the boards and he was running the floor and putting pressure on them." Richard Hamilton  led the Pistons with 20 points, but couldn't keep the Pistons from their longest losing streak since just before they acquired  Rasheed Wallace  in 2004. "This is a different team than the one that had that long run together," Pistons coach  Michael Curry  said. "There are some of the same faces out there, but this is a different group." Detroit, with  Tayshaun Prince  and Hamilton already playing at less than 100 percent, got a scare when  Allen Iverson  hurt his knee in the third period. Iverson stole an inbounds pass, but landed awkwardly after his layup was blocked by  Rasual Butler . Iverson was helped off the court by the Pistons' training staff, but returned to start the fourth quarter. "I don't think I've ever hit the floor that hard on my knee," Iverson said. "We'll see how it feels tomorrow, but right now I have no idea how I'll be." The knee wasn't the foremost thing on Iverson's mind after the game, though, as he thought back to Detroit's recent seven-game winning streak. "We've got to get back to what we were doing when we won all those games in a row," Iverson said. "It doesn't matter that we played hard tonight -- we're paid to play hard every night. It doesn't make me happy when we play hard. Am I frustrated? Is there something beyond frustrated? That's where I am." To make things worse, Prince aggravated his strained groin, and also is a question mark for Monday's game in Memphis. Two of the league's lowest-tempo offenses combined for a low-scoring first half, with New Orleans holding a 39-37 advantage behind eight points and seven assists from Paul. Rasheed Wallace hit back-to-back 3-pointers to pull the Pistons even midway through the third quarter, and the Pistons led by a point going into the fourth. The Hornets, scored the first nine points of the period to take their biggest lead of the game, but Detroit came back to tie the game at 79. With the game still tied, Iverson made a huge mental mistake when he was called for an 8-second violation even though he wasn't being pressured by New Orleans. "I don't think I've ever been called for that before," he said. "Never." Paul answered with a bank-shot jumper at the shot-clock buzzer, and  James Posey 's runner made it 85-81 with 90 seconds left. Paul iced the game with a driving layup to make it 89-84 with 26 seconds to go. "Going into Dallas, Cleveland and Detroit, if you win two of those three, you'll take it every time," Chandler said. "Those are tough games, and we came back two and one." Game notes  Iverson got a technical foul early in the fourth that helped New Orleans' 9-0 run. ...
