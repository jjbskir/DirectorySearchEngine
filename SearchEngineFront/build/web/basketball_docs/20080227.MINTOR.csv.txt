TORONTO (AP) -- After another frustrating loss,  Minnesota Timberwolves  coach Randy Wittman warned his players to show more consistency -- or start looking for work elsewhere. Chris Bosh  scored 28 points,  T.J. Ford  had 16 and the  Toronto Raptors  beat the Timberwolves for the eighth straight time, 107-85 on Wednesday night. Still buzzing from a 111-100 home win over Utah the night before, Minnesota looked good early, taking a 10-point lead midway through the first quarter. Six minutes later, the lead was all but gone and the Timberwolves were headed for another dispiriting defeat. Wittman scolded his team for failing to match the effort it showed against Utah. "If you want to get to the position of being a playoff team, a win like that you have to back up with an effort the next night," Wittman said. "That's going to be the difference on whether you're going to make it in the league or not. That's what we're trying to find out here, who are we moving forward with while we're rebuilding this? If you can't understand that for 82 games, we'll find someone who can." Al Jefferson  scored 23 points and  Rashad McCants  had 19 for the Timberwolves, who have lost eight of their past 10. Randy Foye  added 18 points as Minnesota dropped to 2-24 on the road and 1-11 in the second game of back-to-backs. "We've only won 12 games," Foye said. "You can't be satisfied with one night. You've got to keep trying to win every night." Andrea Bargnani  had 12 and  Jamario Moon  added 11 for Toronto, which has won five of six overall and four straight at home. The Raptors have won their past eight by an average margin of 22.3 points. "We kind of looked shaky in the first quarter," Ford said. "They were playing so well, but we were able to control it from the second to the end of the game." Toronto hasn't lost to Minnesota since a 108-97 defeat on Jan. 21, 2004. The Timberwolves made seven of their first 10 shots to open a 17-7 lead midway through the first, but couldn't hold the lead until the end of the quarter. Toronto got back in it with a 14-4 run during the next four minutes, and a fadeaway jumper by Ford with 22 seconds left in the first gave the Raptors a 26-25 lead, their first of the night. "We scored so easily and so often early, we kind of fell into a sense of false [security] and our defense just went to pot," Wittman said. Foye had 13 points in the first, going 5-for-5 from the field and 3-for-3 from beyond the 3-point arc. But he didn't score at all in the second as the Raptors slowly pulled away behind nine points from Ford, building a 51-43 advantage at the half. "I got off to a great start because we were moving the ball and everyone was getting open looks," Foye said. "Once we stopped, that's when they took advantage. They made their run and we couldn't get back in it." A 10-3 run in the opening three minutes of the third gave Toronto a 61-46 lead, forcing the Timberwolves to call timeout. They never recovered, and trailed 85-64 heading into the fourth. Bosh scored 14 in the third, making seven of eight from the field. "You've got to be on your toes when you go against him," Jefferson said of defending Bosh. "I always take that matchup seriously because if you don't, he'll embarrass you." Minnesota guard  Kirk Snyder  was ejected after picking up his second technical at 8:43 of the fourth. Snyder, acquired in a trade with Houston last week, also got a technical for arguing a call in the second. He finished with three points in 17 minutes. "The first one I thought was just a terrible call," Wittman said. Game notes  Minnesota forward  Antoine Walker  didn't travel to Toronto because of what Wittman called "a passport problem." Wittman didn't expect Walker to travel by himself to Cleveland for Friday's game because Walker would likely be inactive against the Cavaliers. ... The Raptors went 24-for-28 from the free-throw line. ... Actor Will Ferrell was at the Air Canada Centre before the game, sitting down for mock interviews with Chris Bosh and Jamario Moon to promote an upcoming movie about basketball.
