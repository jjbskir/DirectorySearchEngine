OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The New Orleans Hornets had the misfortune
of playing San Antonio one night after the Spurs' worst loss of the
season. Almost everything the Spurs did poorly Friday night in a
19-point loss to Houston, they did well in a 112-77 romp over the
Hornets on Saturday night. Elias Says Tim Duncan played in the 500th regular-season win of his NBA career on Saturday.  The Spurs have a 500-194 record in games that Duncan has played.  Duncan is the first player to win at least 500 of his first 700 NBA games since Byron Scott did it playing exclusively for the Lakers (19831992). Larry Bird holds the NBA record for fewest games to 500 wins (500164), followed by James Worthy (500175), Magic Johnson (500176), Bill Russell (500177) and Sam Jones (500179). Duncan's .720 personal winning percentage is the highest among active players who have played at least 500 NBA games.  Rounding out the top five are Shaquille O'Neal (.697, 659-286), Robert Horry (.677, 689-329), Kobe Bryant (.655, 479-252) and Bruce Bowen (.655, 431-227).

others reached double figures as the Spurs shot a season-high 62.9
percent. On Friday night, the Spurs made 40.3 percent of their
shots in a 97-78 loss to the Rockets in San Antonio. The Spurs eclipsed the 100-point mark for the 17th time this
season, thanks to 12-of-16 shooting from 3-point range -- 75
percent, another season high. San Antonio entered the game leading
the NBA in 3-point shooting at 41.3 percent. "We know what we're capable of, and to have a game like that
(against Houston), it was very disappointing for everybody," San
Antonio forward  Bruce Bowen  said. "We just tried to make amends
for that." The Spurs have won five straight games against the Hornets,
including three in a row on the road -- two in nine days. On Dec.
14, the Spurs routed the Hornets in New Orleans 103-77. After an 8-3 start, the injury-riddled Hornets -- playing without
three of their top six players -- have lost 12 of 15. "We're always a good defensive team, but this year we haven't
gotten that consistency yet," San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich
said. "I thought that tonight, we did, and of course New Orleans
gave us a break with the number of guys that they have out at this
point." Chris Paul  led the Hornets with 20 points, but from the middle
of the second quarter on, New Orleans trailed by double digits and
never made a serious run at the Spurs. Hornets coach Byron Scott,
who usually stands during games, did not rise from the bench in the
second half, except during timeouts. "I didn't think we got into it at all," Scott said. "I
thought last night's game (a 100-97 overtime win over Memphis)
looked like it took a little more out of us than it should have. I
thought that we would be a lot more ready than we were tonight. "You know after losing the way they did last night (the Spurs)
were going to come in here ready (to play)." New Orleans' lone bright spot was on the boards, where the
Hornets outrebounded San Antonio 40-32. San Antonio is 10-2 in December and has won six of its last
seven games. The Spurs shot 60.5 percent from the field in the first half and
led by as many as 17 points before settling for a 60-48 halftime
lead. San Antonio took the lead for good at 14-12 on a 3-point play by
Parker midway through the first quarter and led 30-20 by the end of
the period. The Hornets twice cut the lead to one point, the final time at
36-35 with 6:57 left before halftime, but the Spurs used a 24-8 run
-- highlighted by 3-pointers from Bowen,  Matt Bonner  and Michael
Finley -- to go up 60-43. Down by 12 at halftime, New Orleans came no closer in the second
half. The Spurs stretched their lead to 20 points by midway through
the third quarter and it peaked at 35 points. "When the ball is moving and the guys are making the open shots
it makes everything else seem like a cinch," said  Tim Duncan , who
scored 11 points -- more than 10 points below his career average
against the Hornets. "It's great to have nights like this,
especially after the night we had last night. We were basically the
exact opposite of last night." The Spurs reached the 100-point mark with 6:51 left on a jumper
by Finley. San Antonio finished the game with more assists (33)
than rebounds, led by  Jacque Vaughn , who had 11. "The biggest thing for us tonight was sharing the ball,"
Ginobili said. "When your shots are open it's more likely that
they're going in." Bowen scored 15 points and Matt Bonner added 14 for San Antonio.
 Rasual Butler  scored 16 points for the Hornets. Game notes Paul, who entered the game third in the league in assists,
did not record one Saturday until two minutes into the third
quarter and finished with three, matching his season low. ... San
Antonio's previous best shooting outing of the season came
Wednesday, when the Spurs hit 55.2 percent from the field in a win
over Memphis ... The game drew 19,164 fans to the Ford Center,
giving the Hornets their sixth sellout of the season. Five of those
have come in Oklahoma City, with one in New Orleans.
