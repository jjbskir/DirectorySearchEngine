 Jason Kidd  had 12 points and 12 assists for the Mavericks, who blew out the lifeless Clippers with a 37-point first quarter on the way to a 64-43 halftime lead. Dallas (54-27) has won four straight and seven of nine while holding off Denver (53-28) and Phoenix (52-28) in the race behind the Lakers.

Dallas finished with the NBA's best road record at 27-14, a mark Cleveland and Boston can match with wins in their season finales. The Mavericks have won six straight over the Clippers, including a three-game sweep this season, and 15 of 18. After Nowitzki scored 40 points at Portland and 39 more at Sacramento in the Mavs' last two games, he settled for 9 of 13 shooting -- including three 3-pointers without a miss -- and eight rebounds while playing only the first three quarters against the Clippers. He even extended his streak of consecutive free throws to 72, stretching his own team record. While  Caron Butler  sat out with a strained right hip, Marion returned from a three-game absence with a strained oblique muscle. He sparked the Southwest Division champions' offense with 9-of-12 shooting, including a breathtaking two-handed dunk on an alley-oop pass off the backboard from Kidd to close the first half. Rookie  Rodrigue Beaubois  scored nine points in the first nine minutes while Dallas jumped to an early 32-16 lead and didn't let up, eventually leading by 33 points before the reserve-filled fourth quarter.
