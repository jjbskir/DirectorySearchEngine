PHOENIX (ESPN.com news services) -- Without  Kevin Garnett  and  Ricky Davis , the  Minnesota Timberwolves  had no chance against the streaking  Phoenix Suns . Shawn Marion  had 17 points and 20 rebounds, then sat out the fourth quarter as the Suns won their 13th in a row with a 131-102 rout of the depleted Timberwolves on Sunday night. "Incredible," the Suns'  Steve Nash  said. "It's not everyday you see a small forward get 20 rebounds in three quarters. That's for sure." The Suns became the eighth team in NBA history to have two winning streaks of at least 13 games in a season. Phoenix won a franchise-record 15 straight from Nov. 20 to Dec. 19. With Garnett and Davis serving one-game suspensions, rookie  Randy Foye  matched his NBA high with 25 points, including 5-for-6 on 3-pointers, for Minnesota.  Troy Hudson  added season-best 22 points and  Trenton Hassell  20. It was Marion's second career 20-rebound game. He had 24 at home against Charlotte on Feb. 25, 2006. "I'm just going to get it, just trying to run it down," Marion said. "If it's in my area, I'm going to get it." Amare Stoudemire  scored 25 points on 11-for-14 shooting as the Suns improved to 31-3 since starting the season 1-5. Nash had 16 points and 11 assists. Stoudemire and Nash also didn't play in the fourth quarter.  Leandro Barbosa  added 20 points for the Suns. Phoenix turned the game into a blowout with a 31-2 blitz during a 46-point third quarter, taking a 102-71 lead on Barbosa's 3-pointer with a minute left in the period. "There's a reason this team has won almost 30 games in a row," Minnesota coach Dwane Casey said, "and they played like it in the third quarter. I was proud of how our guys competed without our two leading scorers. I thought they did everything they could. But Phoenix is one of the best teams I've seen in a long time, and I've been around it for a while." Marion tied a U.S. Airways Center record for rebounds in a quarter with 11 in the second. The mark was set by Charles Barkley on Nov. 2, 1996, in his first game back in Phoenix following his trade from the Suns to Houston. "Yeah, I'm better than Charles," Marion said half-seriously. "If I got the ball as much as everybody else did, I'd be just as effective, maybe more effective." Garnett was suspended for throwing a punch at Detroit's  Antonio McDyess  in Friday night's double-overtime loss to the Pistons. Davis was suspended for the contest for leaving the bench and going to the locker room during the Detroit game. With 5:18 left in the fourth quarter on Friday night,
McDyess knocked Minnesota's  Mark Madsen  to the floor with a forearm
shove. 	   Garnett then chucked the ball at McDyess, who charged at Garnett
with his fist cocked. Garnett was poised to punch, too, and took a
swipe at McDyess as he partially retreated. Phoenix took the lead for good in the second quarter and led 58-51 at the half. After  Mike James ' 3-pointer cut Phoenix's lead to 71-65 with 7:43 left in the third quarter, the Suns put the pedal to the floor. Stoudemire's stuff started the outburst, then  Raja Bell  and Marion each made 3-pointers and the rout was on. "That's their game," Foye said. "They just opened it up." The Timberwolves stayed close by making 8-of-11 3-pointers in the first half. Foye was 4-for-5 and Hudson 3-for-4. Hudson played in just his second game since Jan. 3 and may have earned himself some more playing time, Casey said. "In this league, it's all about getting the opportunity to play," Hudson said. "I've just been keeping myself ready, working on my game, coming before and staying after practice. This is a long season. With my experience, 10 years in the league, I know it will always come back around." Seven of the teams beaten by the Suns during the streak were without key players because of injury or suspension, including six all-stars. "We've had some breaks," Phoenix coach Mike D'Antoni said, "but at the same time we've played good basketball, and we haven't beat ourselves in a lot of games. It's going to take somebody to play a great game like Dallas or Washington did to beat us." In the last 31 games, Phoenix's only losses were 144-139 in overtime at home against Washington on Dec. 22 and 101-99 at Dallas on Dec. 28. Game notes  Of the seven other teams that have had two winning streaks of at least 13 games, only two -- the 1946-47 Washington Capitols and 1996-97  Utah Jazz  -- did not win the NBA title. ... Phoenix opens a five-game road trip Tuesday night at Washington. ... The Timberwolves have lost three in a row after reaching a season-best four games above .500.
