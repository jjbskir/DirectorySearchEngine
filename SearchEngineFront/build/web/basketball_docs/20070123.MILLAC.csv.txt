LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Clippers took no mercy on the wounded  Milwaukee Bucks . "We're not going to feel sorry for any other opponent," Los Angeles'  Elton Brand  said Tuesday night after he had 25 points, seven rebounds and five assists in a 115-96 rout of injury-depleted Milwaukee. "They were missing a few key guys, but no one felt sorry for us when we had Sam (Cassell) out and (Chris) Kaman out." Milwaukee's  Michael Redd  is sidelined with a strained left patellar tendon. Also out are  Mo Williams  (shoulder) and  Charlie Villanueva  (shoulder).  Bobby Simmons  is done for the season after having surgery on his right heel. "We were just going to try to jump on them. With Michael out, we could pack it in a little more because he's such a prolific outside shooter," said Brand, who had 23 points in the first half as the Clippers took charge. Brand finished 10-of-15 from the floor and 5-of-6 from the foul line. The Clippers won their third in a row to move within one victory of climbing back to .500. They also handed the Bucks their fourth consecutive loss and ninth in 11 games. Cuttino Mobley  added 22 points and Kaman had 11 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks for the Clippers, who had five scorers in double figures.  Corey Maggette  had 15 points and  Quinton Ross  scored 13. "The other team was short-handed, so we were supposed to win this game," Los Angeles coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "But having said that, we still did a lot of good things." Charlie Bell  had 24 points for Milwaukee, which trailed by 10 at the end of the first quarter and never really got back into the game.  Ruben Patterson  added 16 and  Earl Boykins  14. "There is definitely frustration, but there is no quit in them," Milwaukee coach Terry Stotts said. "Charlie and Earl played the entire first half and third quarter. They are out there giving it their all. Nobody in the locker room likes losing, and we are going to get a win soon." The Bucks'  Brian Skinner , who missed the previous game because of a stomach virus, had four points in 32 minutes. "We just need to focus on what we have," Boykins said. "Right now we are undermanned. We played one half of the game, and with a team like the Clippers you just can't do that." Los Angeles led 89-74 heading into the final quarter. After the Bucks missed their first 10 shots of the period, the Clippers built their biggest lead, 101-76, on Kaman's layup with 7 minutes remaining. The Clippers were up 69-58 at halftime. Los Angeles outscored the Bucks 8-0 over the closing 1:46 of the first quarter to open a 34-24 lead by the end of the period, and held a double-digit lead most of the rest of the game.
