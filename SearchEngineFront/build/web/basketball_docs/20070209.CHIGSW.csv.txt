OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --  Stephen Jackson  stayed calm at one end, then forced  Ben Gordon  to rush on the other. Jackson made two clutch free throws in overtime, then jumped out at Gordon as the Chicago star was attempting the winning shot, leading the  Golden State Warriors  to a 123-121 victory over the Bulls on Friday night. Jackson scored 23 points and helped overcome the loss of the injured  Baron Davis  with eight assists. Jackson, who faces an April 12 court appearance for allegedly firing shots from a handgun during an October altercation in Indianapolis, helped the Warriors beat Chicago at home for the eighth straight time. Monta Ellis  hit the go-ahead jumper with 43 seconds remaining. Jackson gave the Warriors a 122-119 lead with his free throws. "The first thing I do at the line is relax myself and then try to shoot a normal shot," Jackson said. "Thank goodness I was able to make those free throws. This game could have went either way." In the final seconds, Gordon had the ball and a good long range look at the basket. Jackson reacted by leaping at the Bulls' most prolific 3-point shooter. The shot never hit the rim as the buzzer sounded. "I think I made him arch his shot a little more than he wanted," Jackson said. "All I could think to do was jump as high as I could. We wanted to be more aggressive in the overtime and we all made plays to win the game." Al Harrington  scored 24 points before fouling out in the extra period. Ellis finished with 16 points, followed by  Matt Barnes  with 13 points and 12 rebounds. Andris Biedrins  scored four of his 11 points in the first three minutes of overtime, then fouled out with 2:11 left to play. He also had 10 rebounds. "We needed that," Ellis said. "The bench came in and got us going. They knocked down a couple of shots and played good defense." The Warriors overcame a 14-point deficit at the end of the third quarter to win their third straight at home following a 2-4 road trip. Golden State reserves  Josh Powell ,  Kelenna Azubuike  and  Sarunas Jasikevicius  scored the first 15 points of the fourth quarter, rallying the Warriors to 97-95 with 8:41 left. "Our reserves made the most of their opportunities," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "They were key to the comeback in the fourth quarter." Gordon scored 24 points to lead the Bulls, who haven't won in Oakland since their 1998 championship season.  Luol Deng  added 23 points and  Kirk Hinrich  scored 22 points and had 10 assists.  P.J. Brown  had 19 points. "We had that 14-point lead going into the fourth quarter," Gordon said. "That's a big cushion and you figure if they hit two or three in a row, you can still come back down the court and build the lead back up. We couldn't do that." Consecutive 3-pointers from  Mickael Pietrus  and Jackson ended a 22-6 run to open the final period that put the Warriors ahead 101-99 with 7:20 remaining to play. The lead traded hands several times the rest of the way. The Warriors took a 112-110 lead when Pietrus hit a 3-pointer with 1:18 remaining in regulation. He landed awkwardly on his right foot and was taken out. Brown tied the score with 50 seconds left on a tip in before Harrington missed a 3-pointer and the Bulls had a shot blocked to force the overtime. While Golden State just returned from a six-game road trip in which it went 2-4, the Bulls were playing their sixth straight away from home, falling to 2-4 with a game remaining Sunday at Phoenix. Hinrich and Deng combined for 18 points in the third quarter as the Bulls streaked to a 93-79 advantage after three quarters. They shot 53 percent in the quarter and limited the Warriors to 25 percent. "We built a nice lead," Bulls coach Scott Skiles said. "We just lost focus." Chicago opened the second half with a 19-4 run to pull ahead. Deng's fast-break slam dunk put the Bulls up by 12 midway through the quarter. Golden State led 53-44 with five minutes left in the second quarter. The Bulls drew within one before Pietrus hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer and the Warriors took a 64-61 edge into the locker room at halftime.
