MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With his defending Eastern Conference champions looking rather ordinary so far this season,  LeBron James  has decided to take matters into his own hands. Barely breaking a sweat, James had 45 points, eight rebounds and five assists to carry the  Cleveland Cavaliers  to a 97-86 victory over the  Minnesota Timberwolves  on Wednesday night. It's been a breathtaking four-game stretch for King James, who topped 40 points for the second time in three games and is averaging 39.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 9.5 assists in the previous four to get the Cavs (6-6) back to .500. "I don't know how he keeps doing what he does," coach Mike Brown said. "I'm watching him, and I get exhausted. That's how good it is to be able to do that night after night after night." Drew Gooden  added 17 points and nine rebounds and  Dwayne Jones  chipped in 10 rebounds off the bench for Cleveland, but this was the LeBron Show from start to finish. "I wasn't forcing anything," James said. "I was just taking what was there." James was on a roll from the start, scoring 15 points on 6-for-9 shooting in the first quarter to help the Cavs take an early lead. He added 17 more in the fourth to keep the Wolves at bay, dropping them to 1-8 to start the season. "We've got guys [who], when we get punched in the mouth, we quit, we stop playing," Wolves coach Randy Wittman said. "Whether it hits or doesn't hit, we have to throw something back." Al Jefferson  had 30 points and eight rebounds for the Timberwolves, who threatened in the fourth quarter before James put the game away with a stunning two-minute haymaker. "He knows when he needs to step up and do his thing," Brown said. "And he did it tonight." With the Cavs clinging to a six-point lead, James scored 10 straight points. He hit two long 3-pointers and then had a steal and soaring dunk to punctuate his evening and help Cleveland avoid falling into what he called "a trap game." "That pretty much put the nail in the coffin," James said. In what has become a recurring theme for the young Wolves this season, they were outshot at the free-throw line by an enormous margin, 33-13. They sorely miss point guard  Randy Foye , who will be out at least another three weeks with a knee injury. With backup  Sebastian Telfair  in New York for his grandmother's funeral, Wittman had to turn to veterans  Greg Buckner  and  Marko Jaric  to be the primary ball-handlers. The result was another stagnant offensive performance in which the Wolves had difficulty running their sets and getting good looks at the basket, especially in the fourth quarter. "Teams make a run, we get in the habit of putting our heads down instead of keep fighting," Jefferson said. Game notes   Mark Madsen , who has missed the first seven games after having offseason shoulder surgery because of an accident on a personal watercraft, played for the first time on Wednesday night. He entered the game with 4:40 to go in the first quarter and finished with three rebounds in 13 minutes. ... Minnesota Vikings RB Adrian Peterson was in attendance and received a standing ovation in the fourth quarter.
