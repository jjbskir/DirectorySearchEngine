PHILADELPHIA -- With supportive tape wrapped around both his feet and a turf toe, it was clear  Kyle Korver 's aching feet needed a cold soak and still more time to heal. Somehow, even without a best foot to put forward, Korver's 3-point shot rarely looked better. Korver made six 3-pointers and matched a career high with 31 points to lead the  Philadelphia 76ers  to a 104-84 victory over the  New York Knicks  on Wednesday night. "I felt strong out there, I got some good looks early and I was able to get into a little bit of a flow," Korver said. Knicks coach Isiah Thomas said before the game that sometimes the schedule, like back-to-backs, beats a team more than the opponent. This one, though, had everything to do with the Sixers. Mostly, it had to do with Korver. He scored 14 points in the second quarter while the Sixers took a 15-point lead. After the Knicks whittled the lead down to five in the fourth, he sank a pair of 3s that pushed back New York and help Philadelphia snap a three-game losing streak. Korver was sensational off the bench, going 6-for-7 from 3-point range and 11-of-14 overall. He matched the 31 points he scored at Milwaukee last season. "We all know that Kyle has the ability to make shots like that and when he does that, it opens up the game," coach Maurice Cheeks said. Andre Miller  scored 19 points,  Joe Smith  had 14 and  Steven Hunter  11 for the Sixers, who finished 3-4 on their season-high seven-game homestand. Eddy Curry  had 22 points and  Jamal Crawford  14 for the Knicks, who beat Orlando a night earlier.  Renaldo Balkman  scored 13 and  Stephon Marbury  had 12 points for the Knicks. "Our desire and intensity just faded and went out the window," Thomas said. "We have to make a decision of how bad do we really want it. Our fans want it right now more than our players want it right now. There's no explanation for what happened here tonight other than just a matter of desire." Balkman, who was sensational during a big Knicks run in the third, turned a sharp entry pass into a layup underneath, and Crawford sank two free throws that trimmed the lead to 76-71 in the fourth. Then Korver started another string of big baskets and didn't seem at all bothered by the turf toe in his left foot and plantar fasciitis in his right that's caused him recent discomfort. He scored on a driving layup and sank a free throw, and then Smith made a 20-footer for a 10-point lead and some needed breathing room. Marbury converted a three-point play, only to have Korver come right back and drill a 3. Marbury sank a 3-pointer, and then Korver did what he does best -- bury another 3. When he hit his sixth 3-pointer of the game late in the fourth, the Sixers went ahead 97-80 and the Knicks had no more runs left. Korver said rest over the All-Star break helped his feet, though they started feeling sore again in the second half. "It's something I can deal with the rest of the season," he said. With Sixers leading scorer  Andre Iguodala  held without a field goal for most of the first three quarters, the Knicks took advantage and rallied back from a 15-point halftime deficit. Balkman had a pair of thunderous dunks that got an "Ooh!" out of another minuscule crowd. He hit a 3 that cut the gap to 70-63 and Crawford added one earlier during a 19-4 run that helped bring them within seven. New York made 12-of-22 shots in the third. The Knicks rallied without  Quentin Richardson , who was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with a bruised left shoulder. The Knicks built an 11-point lead before it was wiped out by some torrid shooting. Korver and  Louis Williams  each hit 3-pointers during a 10-0 run that opened the second quarter. Korver's 3 made it 41-29 and the Sixers eventually stretched the lead to 15 points -- a 26-point turnaround from late in the first quarter. Led by Korver, Sixers reserves scored 32 points in the first half on 13-for-17 shooting. Green made all four of his shots and Korver went 3-for-4 from 3-point range to take a 53-38 lead. Korver scored 19 points in the first half while Philadelphia's starting five combined for 21. Carney,  Samuel Dalembert  and Iguodala went a combined 0-for-8. "I don't think you can count on 50 points off the bench every night," Korver said. Actually, Philly's bench players scored 58 -- one of the few times Korver was off the mark. Game notes  Knicks forward  David Lee  sat out with the flu. ... Thomas said he didn't see a trade "on the horizon." "We're definitely headed in the right direction," he said. Cheeks also said he had no indication the Sixers would make a trade before Thursday's deadline. ... Hunter said he felt fine after playing with his dislocated left pinkie finger in a wrap.
