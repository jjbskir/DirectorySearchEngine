 "Paul made a couple blocks, got a couple steals and knocked the ball out of people's hands. I thought he was terrific tonight," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "He stays around the baskets and he stays after it." Deron Williams  had 25 points and 15 assists,  Ronnie Brewer  scored seven crucial points down the stretch to help the Jazz hold off the Warriors. "Finishing is the key thing for us. They tried to make a run and we withstood it," Millsap said. Williams tied his season high in assists as the Jazz led most of the way but could never break the game open from the Warriors, despite the loss of  Stephen Jackson  to a hamstring injury at the end of the first half. Neither team led by more than nine in the run-and-gun contest. Mehmet Okur  had 20 points and 11 rebounds and  Andrei Kirilenko  added 15 for the Jazz. Corey Maggette , in his first action back from his own hamstring injury that cost him 15 games, brought the Warriors within 108-105 with two free throws. Millsap scored and then blocked a shot that led to Brewer's dunk at the other end. Brewer added two free throws and then a three-point play with 1:14 remaining to give the Jazz a 117-110 lead and seal the win. "We knew we had to stop their inside game. They scored a lot of points in the lane, and it was too much," Millsap said. "So we just said 'enough' and went back out and played good 'D'." Jamal Crawford  scored 28 points and Maggette had 23 points in his return but the Warriors have now lost four of five games and were winless on their three-game road trip. "I think our team really played extremely hard tonight. I think our team did a lot of good things," Maggette said. Andris Biedrins  had 14 points and 17 rebounds, but no other Warrior grabbed more than five boards. Jackson strained his right hamstring on the final play of the first half against the Utah Jazz and did not return. The Warriors' leading scorer had 15 points in the opening half and was chasing Williams near midcourt when he suddenly stopped and grabbed his right thigh. "I'm looking at the bigger picture, and it's just weird for us because when somebody comes back, somebody else goes out. We got Corey back, and then Stephen went down. It's tough," Crawford said. He had to be helped off the court after Williams scored in the lane and the Jazz took a 65-59 lead into the break. The Jazz won their ninth consecutive home game against the Warriors, including three victories in the 2007 Western Conference semifinal series. Golden State's last win at Utah was on Nov. 25, 2005, 94-90. The game was the first of a four-game homestand for Utah. "We definitely needed this one, to build our confidence at home," Williams said. "We've got some tough games ahead of us, but this is time where we can go on a streak. We had a successful January last year, why not do it again?" Game notes  Just before halftime, a fan blew a whistle and many of the Warriors stopped playing while  Kyle Korver  dribbled the ball down for an uncontested dunk. The public address announcer warned the crowd against unauthorized whistles but the play stood. ... "Hot" Rod Hundley broadcast his 3,000th game as the radio voice of the Jazz.
