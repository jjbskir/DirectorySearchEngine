PHOENIX (AP) -- The  Phoenix Suns  got home at 4 a.m., then sleepwalked through their home opener. The result was a 119-98 rout at the hands of the  Los Angeles Lakers . More games like this and  Kobe Bryant  might not want to leave Los Angeles. Vladimir Radmanovic  made all four of his 3-pointers and scored 19 points, and Bryant added 16 points and 11 rebounds Friday night in a game that was not nearly as close as the final 21-point margin. The only interesting moment down the stretch came when Suns coach Mike D'Antoni became livid when Lakers coach Phil Jackson called a timeout, right after the Suns called one, with 4:55 to play and Phoenix trailing 111-78. "Yeah, I was pretty upset," D'Antoni said. "I thought he disrespected our players. But he likes to play the mind games and that's fine. He might want to try to do it in playoff time when we bust them every year." Jackson said he was just getting a mandatory timeout out of the way. "He wasn't thinking straight. That's all," Jackson said of D'Antoni. "He'd understand that if he thought about it for a second. I think he thought I was trying to showboat or grandstand. But when you have a mandatory timeout coming in a minute and a half or something like that, just get it out of the way." The capacity crowd at US Airways Center booed the home team, often, for the first time in recent memory as the Suns lost at home to the Lakers for the first time in the regular season since  Steve Nash  came to Phoenix in 2004. "We're clearly not the same team we've been in the past yet," Nash said. "There are a lot of things we didn't do out there on the court, combined with the fact that we got home at four in the morning and maybe we aren't in shape for that yet." Nash was referring to the team's arrival in Phoenix in the predawn hours from their season-opening trip to Seattle. That's one reason not to make too much of the blowout, Jackson said. "I'm sure they got in really late and they looked like it," he said. "It's tough from their home fans in that kind of a game. We played. Don't take anything away from what we did. They just didn't play the way they usually do." Phoenix, the three-time defending Pacific Division champion, fell behind by 17 in the second quarter, 29 in the third and an embarrassing 33 in the fourth, giving up a seemingly endless series of layups, dunks and open jumpers. "For whatever reason, the juice wasn't there," D'Antoni said, "and it's got to be. We can't be small, light and slow, and that's what we were tonight." Radmanovic, questionable before the game because of a sore throat, shot 6-of-7. Bryant, coming off a 45-point game in Los Angeles' season-opening loss to Houston, was just one of the guys in this one as five Lakers reached double figures. "We expected them to be a little tired from last game, but Phoenix is a good team," Radmanovic said. "It's not a team you're going to beat by 30 points every night. It felt good." The Lakers shot 57 percent, 8-of-13 from 3-point range.  Andrew Bynum  had 14 points and 13 rebounds. Bryant said no one should get carried away by one big victory. "We don't have to get too ahead of ourselves," he said. "We just have to stay in the minute. We have to get out of here, get some rest and get ready to practice tomorrow because that's really when you become a better team. You have to play just as hard at practice tomorrow as you did tonight." Amare Stoudemire  was 2-for-10 shooting for four points and had one rebound in 24 miserable minutes for Phoenix. Nash had 19 points but only three assists and sat out the fourth quarter, as did most of the Lakers' starters.  Leandro Barbosa  led the Suns with 23, 17 in the fourth quarter.  Shawn Marion  had 14 points and 10 rebounds, and  Grant Hill  scored 12 in his first home game for the Suns. Game notes  Nash was presented with the J.
