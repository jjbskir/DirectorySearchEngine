PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Even without  Brandon Roy , the surprising  Portland Trail Blazers  found a way to win. This time,  Martell Webster  stepped up. Webster had a career-high 26 points, 24 in the third quarter alone, and the Blazers got some revenge against Utah by beating the Jazz 103-89 on Saturday night. Earlier this week, the Jazz snapped a 13-game Portland winning streak with a 111-101 victory in Salt Lake City. "I told everybody, 'Brandon's not in the game so we all gotta step it up,' " Webster said. "Coach called the play for me, I hit the shot and he just kept running with it. I let it go with confidence and it was going in for me tonight." Webster made 10 straight shots in the third quarter, including three 3-pointers. He finished just one shy of  Terry Porter 's team record of 25 points in a quarter against the Warriors in 1992. LaMarcus Aldridge  added 20 points, and the Blazers played most of the game without Roy, who had a sore tailbone. Portland, which led by as many as 20 points, has won three straight since the streak-stopping loss. The team has lost just one of their last 17 games. The Blazers have an 11-game winning streak at the Rose Garden and are 16-3 at home overall. Deron Williams  had 23 points for the Jazz, who have lost three of their last five. "They were playing the game with a great deal of passion and excitement," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said about the Blazers. "It was a real bear's den to be involved in." Utah was without forward  Andrei Kirilenko , who did not travel with the team because of lower back inflammation. Kirilenko is averaging 11.5 points, six rebounds and 4.8 assists for the Jazz this season. Against the Trail Blazers earlier this week, he had 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Roy, who bruised his tailbone in Portland 115-109 double-overtime victory at Chicago on Thursday night, started but then sat the rest of the way. He scored four points. "I might have been the biggest fan in the gym," he said. "What Martell did was unbelievable. I've never been a part of anything like that." Aldridge picked up the slack with 17 points in the first half for the Blazers. The Jazz pulled ahead 36-30, but Portland managed to narrow it to 42-39 at the break. The Blazers were hampered by 12 turnovers. Roy remained out in the second half but stayed on the bench and the Jazz pulled out front, going up 57-50 on  Mehmet Okur 's 3-pointer. Okur finished with 15 points. Webster's trio of free throws put the Blazers in front at 62-61, and he added a jumper and a 3-pointer to make it 67-61. Webster made a pair of free throws to cap a 21-4 run and give Portland a 71-61 lead. "It was in high school the last time I pulled something like that," Webster said. "I had 46 points on Senior Night with 26 consecutive points. And that was only 8-minute quarters." Portland built a 75-64 lead at the end of the third. They were 14-of-24 from the floor and made all 11 free throw attempts during the quarter. Webster pounded his chest and the sellout crowd at the Rose Garden gave him a standing ovation at the break before the fourth. "That surprised me. I've never seen anything like that in my life," teammate  Jarrett Jack  said. "And they kept leaving him open, I couldn't understand it." Portland scored a season-best 64 points in the second half. Game notes  Blazers coach Nate McMillan said he plans to send rookies  Josh McRoberts  and  Taurean Green  to the NBA's Developmental League later this week. "They're not getting a lot of practice time or time out on the floor so I'm trying to get them some minutes," McMillan said. ... Blazers owner Paul Allen, who also owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, watched the Seahawks defeat the Washington Redskins 35-14 in the NFC wild-card playoffs earlier Saturday. He made it in time for opening tipoff. ... Utah coach Jerry Sloan gave no timetable for Kirilenko's return. "For what we know, the tests have been OK, so we'll just have to go from there," he said. ... The Blazers and Jazz played four times in the span of 26 days, with Portland finishing the season series 3-1.
