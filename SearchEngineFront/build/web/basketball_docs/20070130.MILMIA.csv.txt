MIAMI -- Having done enough damage in the first three quarters,  Dwyane Wade  got to sit out the fourth against the  Milwaukee Bucks . Wade scored 28 points on 12-for-17 shooting from the field, and watched the final period from the bench as the  Miami Heat  beat the Bucks 110-80 on Tuesday night to snap a three-game losing streak. "I came in tonight wanting to get my teammates involved in the game," Wade said. "Sometimes when I do that, it sets me up, too. I was getting a lot of open looks."

Miami, playing without injured starters  Shaquille O'Neal  and  Jason Williams , never trailed after Wade's 10 points keyed a 17-4 run to build a 25-12 lead with 4:23 remaining in the first quarter. The Heat also scored the final 10 points of the period, with  Michael Doleac  capping the run with a jumper at the buzzer for a 35-14 lead. "I felt we defended hard from the beginning of the game, I felt we had really good ball movement in the first half," Heat interim coach Ron Rothstein said. "When you are making that kind of effort and everyone is playing together, quite often you make the game significantly easier." Doleac had his first double-double of the season with 11 points and 11 rebounds for Miami. "It feels good to make a contribution in a win like this," said Doleac, who logged a season-high 31 minutes. Miami shot 60 percent from the field and 7 of 13 from 3-point range. "With what we've been through the past couple of games, we just wanted to start with this win and try to build on it," said  James Posey , who finished with 13 points. Charlie Villanueva  scored 17 points to lead the Bucks, who have lost six of seven. "Miami and Milwaukee are both in the same positions and Miami took charge early," Milwaukee coach Terry Stotts said. Antoine Walker 's 3-pointer with 24 seconds remaining in the first half pushed Miami's lead to 66-35. The Heat converted on 29 field goals in the first two quarters, their highest for a half this season. "That was our worst defensive half this year," Stotts said. "I thought we were a step late on everything. Some of it was poor communication; some of it was lack of alertness." The victory also helped the Heat avenge a 121-95 loss at Milwaukee on Dec. 20. "They showed us that they are the NBA champions for a reason and they proved to us that that game was a fluke," Bucks center  Andrew Bogut  said. Jason Kapono  hit three 3-pointers in a 1:09 span to increase Miami's lead to 81-49 with 6:21 left in the third quarter. Kapono finished with 15 points and converted on 6 of 9 shots. The Bucks went scoreless through a 6:20 stretch spanning the first two quarters.  Ruben Patterson 's short jumper 2:16 into the second finally ended the scoring drought and pulled Milwaukee to 38-16. "The only thing we took pride in was shooting the ball," Patterson said. "We weren't like a professional team out there. We were like a high school team. "That effort out there was terrible." O'Neal was sidelined with a left calf injury while Williams sat out because of inflammation on his left foot. "Things were kind of taking a slide so we needed to come out and put together a good effort more than anything," Doleac said. Milwaukee was again without leading scorer  Michael Redd , who missed his 12th consecutive game because of a left knee injury. Game notes  Wade tied a franchise best with 20 or more points in 12 consecutive games. Wade has done it on three previous occasions with  Alonzo Mourning  having the other 20-point streak of 12 straight consecutive games. ... Milwaukee is 2-10 since Redd's injury.
