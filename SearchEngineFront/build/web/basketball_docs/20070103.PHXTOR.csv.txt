TORONTO (AP) --  Steve Nash  struggled for most of his first game
in Canada this season before showing in the fourth quarter why he
is a two-time MVP. Nash scored 13 of his 15 points in the fourth to lead the
 Phoenix Suns  to a 100-98 victory over the  Toronto Raptors  on
Wednesday night. Nash was only 1-for-7 from the field through three quarters, but
he recovered in the fourth. The Canadian -- dubbed "Captain
Canada" -- scored eight of Phoenix's final nine points. "I just felt really slow and old for three quarters and then
all of a sudden I had a rebirth," said Nash, who had eight points
in the final 1:19. He also had nine assists for the Suns, who are 22-3 since
starting the season 1-5. "That was a struggle for me," Nash said. "Physically I didn't
feel great and I didn't play great, but my teammates did a great
job of sticking with it and I just tried to be there for them in
the fourth quarter." Attendance was 20,063 -- the fifth largest regular-season crowd
in Air Canada Centre history. Toronto's  Chris Bosh  returned from a 12-game absence and had 26
points and 14 rebounds. After Bosh's layup gave Toronto a 92-91 lead with 1:23 left,
Nash followed just four seconds later with a 3-pointer to regain
the lead for Phoenix. Bosh followed with a three-point play to give Toronto a 95-93
lead with 1:02 left, but Bosh fouled Nash on a 3-point attempt.
Nash made his first free throws of the game to give Phoenix a 97-95
lead with 43 seconds left. After Toronto's  Andrea Bargnani  committed an offensive foul,
Nash made a 15-foot fadeaway jumper over Bosh to make it 99-95 with
11 seconds remaining. "It takes a lot of guts to take those shots that he takes, but
that's why he is who he is," Bosh said. Toronto's  Anthony Parker  followed with a 3-pointer, but Shawn
Marion made one of two free throws and Toronto's  Darrick Martin 
missed badly on a 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded. "Steve made some big shots for us. He came up big for us at the
end. What more can you ask," Marion said. Raja Bell  had 17 points and eight rebounds for the Suns, who had six
players score in double figures. The Suns went 3-0 on their eastern
road trip. Toronto has lost three straight. The Suns led by as many as 17 in the first half, but Martin
rallied Toronto with consecutive 3-pointers during a 10-0 run in
the fourth quarter as Toronto took a one-point lead. The Raptors played without two other starters. Point guard T.J.
Ford missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle
and forward  Jorge Garbajosa  missed the game with a strained calf. Bosh said he felt good. He played 41 minutes. Game notes Nash received the 2006 Lionel Conacher Award as Canadian
male athlete of the year before the game. He was asked about
winning a third straight MVP. "Having won twice, I never would
have predicted that, so my bank account's full, I can't really
lose," Nash said. "If I don't win it this year, it's no big deal.
If I do, it obviously would just be incredible." ... Former Raptor
