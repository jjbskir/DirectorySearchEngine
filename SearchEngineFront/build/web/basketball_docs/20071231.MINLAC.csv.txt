LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Despite shooting a franchise-worst 0-for-14 from 3-point range, the  Los Angeles Clippers  still found a way to beat the NBA's worst team. Chris Kaman  had 16 points and 16 rebounds to help the Clippers
erase an 11-point deficit and beat the hapless 
 Minnesota Timberwolves  91-82 on Monday night. "They're just not that good, so we were able to beat them," Kaman said. "We're not that good, either. I mean, it was like a 'Dust Bowl' game -- two of the worst teams in the league playing each other." Cuttino Mobley  scored 18 points and  Corey Maggette  added 17 for the injury-ravaged Clippers, who snapped a six-game losing streak and a seven-game home skid. "Obviously, 2007 brought a lot of injuries. January 1st is tomorrow, and I'm not sure that's going to make it end -- but hopefully, that is the case and it's run its course," coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. Elton Brand  and  Shaun Livingston  have yet to play this season and aren't expected back until March 1 at the earliest.  Tim Thomas  also didn't play because of a sprained left knee, hurting the Clippers' perimeter shooting considerably. "We know our situation," Dunleavy said. "I hate the fact that we're injured and we haven't been winning. But I absolutely love where we are, as far as the pieces we have in place and how far we can go if we're healthy. I think we can have one of the best teams in the West." Al Jefferson  led Minnesota with 23 points and 15 rebounds, while  Ryan Gomes  added 17 points and 15 rebounds. But coach Randy Wittman was upset about the play of guards  Rashad McCants ,  Sebastian Telfair  for former Clipper  Marko Jaric  -- particularly in the fourth quarter. "I have to find some guards to lead us down the stretch," Wittman said. "We had no direction, no leadership. We have mismatches on the inside that we do not even recognize. It's the same thing every game." The Timberwolves, who traded  Kevin Garnett  to Boston on July 31 and have played without injured point guard  Randy Foye  since the start of the season, are off to the worst start in the franchise's 19-year history (4-26) and own the league's worst record. They would have to go 12-40 the rest of the way to avoid tying their worst record ever, which was 15-67 in 1991-92. "They've had a double hit," Dunleavy said. "They had their best player go in a trade and they had their second-best player get injured. I mean, Foye was right on par with  Brandon Roy  last year, so he's going to mean wins for them." Minnesota increased its five-point halftime lead to 70-59 heading into the fourth quarter, but couldn't put away the Clippers, who had lost all 17 games this season when trailing after three. Maggette's three-point play capped a 15-0 run that gave Los Angeles a 74-70 lead with 7:24 to play. "We defended and we did a good job of stopping them," reserve point guard  Brevin Knight  said. "I keep telling people, if you're not making shots and you can defend and keep them from making shots, it's a standoff. We got some deflections, made it tough for them inside and tried to force them to make outside shots. Then we got into a little rhythm of our own on the offensive end and rolled with it." The Timberwolves missed their first 10 shots in the final period before  Craig Smith  converted a layup into a three-point play with 6:59 left. But The Clippers clinched it at the free-throw line, making seven of nine in the final 1:44. Game notes  This was the first time the Timberwolves played on New Year's Eve in their 19-year history. The Clippers, who had never played on New Year's Eve during the franchise's first 32 seasons in Buffalo, San Diego and Los Angeles, have now done it in six consecutive years -- all at home (3-3). ... The Clippers were 36-45 in 2007 and the Timberwolves were 23-62. ... Ten of the Clippers' 13 games in January will be at home. Their first seven in February will be on the road. ... The Clippers were the only Western Conference team that Minnesota won a season series from in 2006-07, taking two of three.
