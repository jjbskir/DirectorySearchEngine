SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After making 14 straight free throws,  Kevin Martin  stepped to the line in the closing seconds of overtime for two more that would decide the game Wednesday night. Despite comments from the Grizzlies'  Hakim Warrick  about handling the pressure, Martin calmly made a pair of free throws with 7.6 seconds left. Martin finished with 36 points to help the Kings snap a three-game losing streak with a 107-106 victory over the  Memphis Grizzlies . "I was talking to him [Warrick] before he made his free throws [to put Memphis up 106-105], and he came by after I was fouled and said, 'Now the pressure is on you,'" said Martin, who converted all 16 foul shots, establishing a franchise record for most free throws without a miss. "In that situation I've got to look at it like there is nothing to lose. You go to the line and knock them down." With the shot clock running down, Martin drove the lane and was fouled by  Mike Miller , who fouled out on the play. Miller departed the game, shaking his head over the controversial call. "It's a split decision that they have to make on both sides either way," Miller said. "I took the charge, but at the same time I could be way off. So I have no argument about it." After a timeout,  Kyle Lowry  drove to the basket and flipped up an off-balance shot that never hit the rim. Watching on the floor was a helpless  Ron Artest , who was defending on the play. "That was a hard screen [I took], I don't know what happened," Artest said. "We pulled this one out, we needed the win." Artest had 24 points and six steals for the Kings, who have beaten the Grizzlies 19 straight games at Arco Arena.  Brad Miller  contributed 15 points, 17 rebounds and eight assists.  Mikki Moore  added 15 points and seven rebounds. Warrick had 26 points and eight rebounds for Memphis, which committed 24 turnovers. Lowry had 16 points, Miller scored 14 and both  Rudy Gay  and  Javaris Crittenton  added 13. "We shoot 39 percent for the game and they shoot 48 percent and we come up with the victory," Kings coach Reggie Theus said. "We found a way to win, it was not a pretty picture at all." Trailing by one point, Warrick was fouled by Brad Miller on a drive to the basket and converted both free throws to give Memphis a 106-105 lead with 26.2 seconds left. After blocking Artest's shot with 7 seconds left, Gay missed a jumper, sending the game into overtime. "I thought our guys showed a lot of courage out there," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "We fought back from an eight-point deficit and got, I think, eight straight stops. We got into overtime and just couldn't get a break." The road has been a difficult challenge all season for the Grizzlies, who own a 5-30 away record, the worst in the NBA. Memphis beat the Knicks last week to end an 18-game road losing streak. Historically, the Grizzlies have done horribly at Arco Arena, going 1-24 overall, the victory coming in overtime of the final game in the 1997-98 season. The Kings' leading scorer all season, Martin struggled with his shot early, but his aggressive drives kept him at the line all game. Sacramento made its first 25 free throws and was 30 of 31 overall. The Grizzlies scored 10 straight points to tie the game 87-87 on a fast-break layup by Kyle Lowry with 6:27 remaining. With Memphis appearing ready to build its lead to double figures early in the third quarter, the Kings woke up offensively, going on a 22-4 run for a 70-61 lead. Artest had 11 points and Martin added 10 as Sacramento outscored the Grizzlies 38-23 to take an 80-73 lead heading into the fourth period.
