BOSTON (AP) -- The  New Jersey Nets  turned to their leaders to end
a six-game losing streak. Vince Carter  scored 23 points, 16 in the fourth quarter, and
 Jason Kidd  added 19 to lift the Nets to a 106-103 victory over the
 Boston Celtics  on Wednesday night. "We've been playing bad basketball long enough," Carter said.
"We [Kidd and Carter] wanted to change things and this win was
much needed." Paul Pierce 's jumper from the corner gave the Celtics a
two-point lead with 1:41 remaining, but  Richard Jefferson  sank a
3-pointer 22 seconds later to give the Nets the lead for good at
104-103. Carter added a pair of free throws with 17 seconds left after
Pierce missed a long 3-pointer. "We didn't break, but we might have bent though," Kidd said.
"This should help our mental state because our comebacks have
fallen short recently and we were finally able to get over the
hump." Wally Szczerbiak  had a chance to tie it with 3 seconds to go,
but curiously drove baseline and lost the ball out of bounds as
time expired. A frustrated Pierce looked at Szczerbiak holding up
three fingers to indicate how many points were needed to tie the
game. Szczerbiak walked over to Celtics coach Doc Rivers and
apologized as Pierce walked off the court annoyed. "Once I saw him drive I wanted to run over and help him along
because I knew they needed a 3," Carter said. Pierce scored 31 and Szczerbiak added 25 for Boston. "That was an awful loss," Rivers said. "We had so many
opportunities down the stretch, but when you are begging for a 3 at
the end of the game, you've put yourself in a tough position to
begin with." Trailing 92-82 with 9:32 remaining in the game, New Jersey
responded with an 11-0 run, capped by a pair of free throws by
rookie  Hassan Adams , for its first lead since 1:09 remained in the
first quarter. Adams had a career-high 16 points and eight rebounds. Kidd also added eight rebounds and nine assists while snapping a
streak of five straight games scoring in single figures. He was
10-of-43 from the field during that stretch. New Jersey ended a
drought of scoring under 100 points in six straight games. "There is no one we would rather have lead our team than
Kidd," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "He did it with his
defense and it changed the whole complex of the game." Pierce scored nine points during a 13-0 Boston run to give the
Celtics their biggest lead of the game, 77-62 with 4 minutes
remaining in the third. Kidd single-handedly kept the Nets in the
game with 12 points in the third to close the gap to 84-76 after
three. The Celtics (5-9) and Nets (6-9) were fighting for first place
in the Atlantic Division. Gerald Green  and  Al Jefferson  combined to score the first 15
points of the second quarter to give the Celtics a 43-40 lead with
6 minutes remaining in the half. Game notes Pierce and Szczerbiak combined for 23 of Boston's 29 points
in the third quarter. ... Nets C  Nenad Krstic  is averaging career
highs with 16 points and seven rebounds per game. ... Kidd is one
triple-double shy of tying Wilt Chamberlain for third on the career
list at 78. Oscar Robertson is first with 181, followed by Magic
Johnson with 138.
