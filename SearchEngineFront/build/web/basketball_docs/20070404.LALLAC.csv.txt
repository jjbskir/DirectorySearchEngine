LOS ANGELES -- All year long, the  Los Angeles Clippers  have been hearing they're one of the NBA's biggest disappointments. Not anymore. Corey Maggette  scored 22 points, four teammates reached double figures, and the Clippers beat the  Los Angeles Lakers  90-82 Wednesday night for their seventh win in eight games. The loss was the fourth in five games for the Lakers (39-36), whose lead over seventh-place Denver in the Western Conference was cut to a half-game. The Clippers (37-37) trail their crosstown rivals by 1  games, and have a 1 -game lead over Golden State for the eighth and final playoff berth in the West. "In the fourth quarter, our guys did a great job defensively," Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy said. "They locked down the last two minutes. I thought we were particularly strong, and that's the way we need to play." Cuttino Mobley  scored 18 points;  Chris Kaman  had 17 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots;  Jason Hart  had 14 points and seven assists, and  Elton Brand  added 12 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Clippers, who reached the .500 mark for the first time since Feb. 9. "On paper, we're one of the best teams in the league," Kaman said. "We're just starting to jell." The Clippers raised expectations last season by advancing to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in 30 years before falling one win shy of reaching the conference finals. This season has been a struggle from the start. "We're really just trying to find our way," Maggette said. "We've had so many injuries this year, so many problems. We're doing a lot of good things, and we're still getting better." Kobe Bryant  had 29 points and seven rebounds to lead the Lakers, but shot just 13-of-34 including 2-of-10 in the fourth quarter.  Lamar Odom  scored 21 points and  Luke Walton  added 13. The Lakers battled back from a 19-point deficit to draw within two before the Clippers went on a 13-7 run to finish the game. "We were able to mount a little rally out there," Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. "We didn't finish it well." The Lakers played without starting center  Kwame Brown , who aggravated his sprained left ankle in the second quarter of Tuesday night's 111-105 loss to Denver, and were outrebounded 45-35 by the Clippers. Clippers guard  Sam Cassell  didn't play because of back spasms, and probably won't return during the regular season. Bryant made consecutive baskets to cut the Clippers' lead to 77-75 with 8:11 remaining. Neither team scored after that until Mobley made a follow shot with 5:25 left, putting the Clippers ahead by four. Maurice Evans  made a 3-pointer for his only points of the game to draw the Lakers within one, but the Clippers scored the next seven points to make it 86-78 with 3:12 to play. The Lakers weren't closer than four points after that. "We've just got to get going," Bryant said. "We understand the sense of urgency we have to play with." The Clippers hadn't played since Saturday night, while the Lakers were playing their third game in four nights. But Bryant said he didn't believe fatigue was a factor. "If fatigue would be a factor, it would be for me. I'm the oldest guy," he said. "I feel fine. You've just got to let it all hang out this late in the season." The Lakers fell behind by 61-42 early in the third quarter before outscoring the Clippers 27-12 to draw within four. It was 75-69 entering the final period. Maggette, returning to action after missing one game because of a deep chest bruise, scored 14 points in the first quarter, which ended with the Clippers on top 28-22. They led the rest of the way. It was 57-42 at halftime. Game notes  The game was played before an announced crowd of 20,161 -- the Clippers' 10th sellout this season. ...
