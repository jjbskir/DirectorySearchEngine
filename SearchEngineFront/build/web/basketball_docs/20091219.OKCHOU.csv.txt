HOUSTON -- Forget coach Rick Adelman bragging about his team's resilience. The  Houston Rockets  are ready for a rest. Trevor Ariza  scored 31 points and hit five 3-pointers, and the Rockets closed an exhausting run of four games in five days with a 95-90 victory over the  Oklahoma City Thunder  on Saturday night. The Rockets nearly blew a 17-point lead. "I think people just keep talking about being surprised that this team is competing, and that's what you have to do in this league if you want to win, and that's one good thing about our team is that we compete," Adelman said. "They might have gotten a little tired but we had to get through this game and we got the win. We made some big hustle plays in the last two and a half, three minutes, and that was the difference." The Rockets flew home from Dallas, where they beat the Mavericks 116-108 in overtime on Friday night, to face the Thunder. They built a 58-41 lead early in the third quarter and then almost ran out of gas. "It was tough down the stretch," Ariza said. "It's what we try to do. Tonight we were successful. The night before we were successful, so we just have to build from there." It was Houston's 13th straight victory and 10th in a row at home against the Thunder. Carl Landry  sat out the game after breaking several teeth in a collision with Dallas'  Dirk Nowitzki  on Friday night.  Landry, according to the team, was treated Saturday morning by Rockets team dentist Thomas O'Brien. He needed a series of operations, including a root canal and two dental bridges, to repair the damage. Landry is listed as day-to-day.   The Thunder cut Houston's lead to 74-65 at the end of the third quarter and nipped at the Rockets' heels the rest of the game. They pulled within one point, 82-81, on a pair of free throws by  Russell Westbrook  with 5:20 to play, but the Rockets never lost the lead. Kevin Durant , the Thunder's leading scorer, hit only three of his first 12 shots and finished with 13 points.  Jeff Green  led Oklahoma City with 21 points on 6-of-18 shooting. "I liked the way we battled back," Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  said. "I am very proud of the effort and the way this team plays. We dug ourselves a hole and couldn't get out. We got some stops in the fourth quarter but the offensive rebounds killed us." Luis Scola  added 16 points for the Rockets, and  Shane Battier  and  Chuck Hayes  each added 13. Russell Westbrook and  James Harden  scored 15 each for the Thunder. "It was a physical game and very competitive," Green said. "Houston played great and they are a great team that works very hard. We got a spark off the bench but it wasn't enough. We have to do it as a team and continue to play together." The Rockets used a 19-6 run to close the second quarter for a 50-40 lead at the break. Houston hasn't lost to the Thunder since April 4, 2006, when the team was based in Seattle.
