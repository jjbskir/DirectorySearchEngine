WASHINGTON (AP) --  Caron Butler  scored 29 points and the  Washington Wizards  beat the  Miami Heat  109-95 on Friday night to clinch a playoff spot for the fourth straight season. It's the first time the team has qualified for the playoffs in four consecutive seasons since it made five straight appearances from 1983-88. The woeful Heat set a franchise record with 19 3-pointers and still couldn't beat the Wizards, who were without  Antawn Jamison  for the first time this season. Jamison, who averages 21.5 points and a team-leading 10.2 rebounds a game, was sidelined with a sprained right shoulder. Darius Songaila , who started in Jamison's place, had 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists.  Andray Blatche  had 17 points. It was the second game back for Washington's  Gilbert Arenas , who missed 66 games after left knee surgery. He served as a reserve again, finishing with 13 points, eight assists and five rebounds in 21 minutes. Washington took a 20-19 lead when  DeShawn Stevenson  hit a 3-pointer with 2:19 to play in the first quarter. Stevenson's 3 started a 14-4 run that gave the Wizards a 31-23 lead early in the second quarter. They led 60-44 at halftime, and their lead was never fewer than nine points in the second half. Ricky Davis  had a season-high 33 points and  Chris Quinn  finished with 24 for the Heat, who must win two of their final six games to avoid tying the worst record in their 20-year history. Miami, an NBA-worst 13-63, went 15-67 in 1988-89, its first season. Game notes  Washington coach Eddie Jordan did not appear for his pregame media session, but was on the bench for the game. He's suffering from a sinus infection. ... Heat coach Pat Riley, who's missed several games to scout college players in the NCAA tournament, is staying home this weekend. "The Final Four is not the place to scout, anyhow," Riley said. ... Riley said that G  Jason Williams , who's missed the last seven games with a sprained right thumb, wants to play on Sunday against Detroit. ... Miami's last 11 field goals were 3-pointers. Its last two-point field goal came with 4:08 remaining in the third quarter. ... Quinn's 24 points equaled his season high.
