SEATTLE (AP) -- Phil Jackson wondered just what Seattle coach Bob
Hill did to motivate his SuperSonics. "I don't know what went through their psyche. Maybe Bob Hill
jumped up and down on a chair and did something foolish in his
locker room that got them inspired," Jackson said. Nope, the possibility of falling to 0-3 got Seattle inspired
enough. Ray Allen  scored 32 points, and the Sonics picked up their first
victory of the season with a 117-101 win over the Lakers on Sunday
night. Seattle avoided its first 0-3 start since 1985 and picked up a
needed victory with a five-game East Coast road trip starting
Tuesday in Miami. And the Sonics looked very little like the team that gave up 118
points to the Lakers on Friday night. "They've been playing hard, but they haven't been competing,
and that's a collection of a lot of little things," Hill said of
his team. "I thought they did more of those little things. We
played together awfully well." The Sonics were allowing 114 points and 55 percent shooting in
their first two games, continuing a trend from last season when
they were the worst defensive team in the league. But the focus of
Seattle's training camp finally emerged on Sunday. The Lakers shot
49 percent and turned the ball over 22 times. Seattle hit 12 3-pointers and outscored Los Angeles 66-41 in the
middle two quarters. Seattle reached the 100-point mark on Allen's
3-pointer with 10:29 left in the fourth, overcoming a sluggish
start and showing its expected offensive potency. Allen made 10 of 16 shots and added six assists. He got plenty
of help as well.  Rashard Lewis  scored 25 points, including six
3-pointers, and  Luke Ridnour  added 22 points with seven assists. "That's how we've been wanting to play. We've been in the last
couple of games, but we haven't played that good," Ridnour said.
"The second quarter got us going and we were able to carry it over
to the third quarter." In his second game since knee surgery,  Kobe Bryant  led the
Lakers (3-1) with 15 points, but was just 4-of-10 from the field.
He added nine assists and was assessed a technical foul in the
fourth quarter. The Lakers failed to improve to 4-0 for the first time since
2003, when they opened 5-0. Bryant scored 23 points in his season
debut on Friday against the Sonics, but never found an offensive
rhythm this time. At one point in the third quarter, Bryant threw
an errant pass for a turnover, slapped his forehead two or three
times running back down court, then committed a foul. "I don't think we're concerned," Jackson said of Bryant. "Now
it's about finding his timing and getting his rhythm so offensively
he can contribute." Bryant was given a technical foul with 5:18 left for throwing
the ball against the base of the basket after  Brian Cook  was called
for a foul. Bryant indicated afterward he was unaware of the
league's new emphasis about technicals for reactions after the
whistle. "Actually, the time that they had the meeting, I was doing
rehab," Bryant said. "They surprised me with that one." Held scoreless in the fourth quarter on Friday, Allen scored
Seattle's first 12 points of the fourth before Lewis' two free
throws with 3:52 left. Seattle led by 26 late in the third quarter. Reserve  Earl Watson  added 12 points and  Chris Wilcox  had 10 for
Seattle. Rookie Jordan Farmar scored 14 off the bench for the Lakers.
 Lamar Odom , who was averaging 28 points in the Lakers' first three
games, took just six shots and scored 11 points.  Andrew Bynum 
scored all of his 13 points in the first half. "We've got to recognize what's going on offensively. We've got
to execute; get the ball into guys in scoring position," a
frustrated Odom said. Game notes Jackson coached his first road game of the season, after
missing the Lakers' road opener last Wednesday against Golden State
following hip surgery. ... The Sonics honored 16 players at
halftime that were selected by fans to be a part of their 40th
anniversary team. Among those selected were Lenny Wilkens, Nate
McMillan,  Shawn Kemp ,  Gary Payton , Xavier McDaniel, Spencer
Haywood, and current players Allen and Lewis. Kemp received the
loudest cheers and said he's headed to Italy next month to play for
a team in Rome.
