SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --  Kevin Martin  is getting more attention from opposing defenses even though All-Stars  Ron Artest  and  Brad Miller  are back in the  Sacramento Kings ' lineup. A third-year player enjoying a breakout season, Martin scored 27 points to lead the Kings to a 105-85 victory over the  Portland Trail Blazers  on Saturday. Coming off a career-high 35 points against Seattle, Martin got it going again offensively. He made 8 of 13 shots, including 4 of 6 3-pointers, and all seven of his free throws. Despite defenses starting to concentrate on stopping him, few teams have been able to slow Martin down. He is averaging nearly 25 points a game and is shooting 54 percent. "I noticed it a month ago," Martin said when asked if defenses are starting to key on him. "They are playing small guys, big guys on me, and changing it up. They are chasing me a lot more." Martin had considerable help from  Mike Bibby , who scored 20 points in helping the Kings snap a two-game losing streak at Arco Arena. They led by 22 at halftime and despite a sluggish final two quarters, managed to maintain a double-digit lead the rest of the game. Shareef Abdur-Rahim  had 13 points and  Corliss Williamson  and  John Salmons  scored 10 apiece for Sacramento, which has won two straight overall. The Kings showed no effects from playing the previous night in Seattle. They were dominant in the first half, shooting 68 percent, outhustling the Blazers to rebounds and loose balls in building a 65-43 lead. "What is there to talk about? There was no defense," frustrated Seattle coach Nate McMillan said. "This entire month we have been coming out with slow starts and coming in defensively not ready to play." Zach Randolph  scored 24 points for the Blazers, who fell to 2-6 on the road this season and had a season-low point total. Rookie  Ime Udoka  scored 13 points and  Jarrett Jack  had 11. "We came out with a slow start and the Kings ran on us," said Randolph, who only played the first two minutes of the fourth quarter. "We need to focus on scrapping from the get go. If we don't come out with good defensive stops, good teams like the Kings will come out on top." Miller was added to the active roster before the game and scored two points in 15 minutes for the Kings. He was expected to miss at least a month with plantar fascia in his left foot, but came back in three weeks after missing eight games. "It was great to see Brad hit that first jumper (in the second quarter)," Salmons said. "His passing and his shooting opens everything up for us." The lopsided victory allowed the Kings to use Ron Artest sparingly. Suffering from back problems, Artest missed Friday's game in Seattle and got some rest against Portland, playing 22 minutes and scoring three points. Martin had 17 points in the first half and Bibby scored 12. A 31-17 second quarter put the Blazers in comeback mode. But unlike four previous victories in which Portland rallied for a win in the fourth quarter, it never seriously threatened the Kings. Game notes  Artest entered the game late in the first quarter and drew a delay of game for not having his jersey tucked in. ... Portland had a season-low six turnovers in its last game and had committed seven by the midway point in the second quarter. It finished with 14. ... It was only the fourth Saturday home game in the past five years for the Kings. ... The Blazers had no fastbreak points.
