AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) --  Kobe Bryant  was unstoppable at times, scoring 10 straight points in the third quarter and finishing with 39. With the game on the line, though, the  Detroit Pistons  prevented him from attempting a game-winning shot. Tayshaun Prince  made a 3-pointer with 4.5 seconds left and  Lamar Odom  shot an airball, giving Detroit a 90-89 victory over the  Los Angeles Lakers  on Thursday night.

 Bryant was upset about not getting a chance to lift the Lakers to a rare win at The Palace, but talked calmly about it 30 minutes later. "What are you going to do when guys are open? If I catch the ball, what am I going to do, go one on three?" he asked. "We made the right play, we just didn't complete it." Bryant had an unusual triple-double, adding a career-high 11 turnovers and 10 rebounds to his scoring total. "I have to make smarter decisions with the basketball," he said. The Pistons have won nine straight at home over the Lakers, including three games to win the 2004 NBA Finals, dating to Jan. 18, 2002. Detroit led by as many as 17 in the first half, then fell behind when Bryant scored 10 straight to put the Lakers ahead 62-58 with 4:18 left in the third. The Lakers led 72-67 entering the fourth, and it was a seesaw game the rest of the way. Prince led the Pistons with 22 points while All-Stars  Chauncey Billups  and  Richard Hamilton  scored 16 and 14, respectively. Rookie reserves  Arron Afflalo  and  Rodney Stuckey  added 10 apiece. "Tay hit the shot, but the bench is what won it for us," Billups said. Bryant didn't have much help. Derek Fisher  scored 15 and reserve  Ronny Turiaf  had 12 points, but lamented missing a free throw with 17 seconds remaining that proved to be costly. "I feel terrible because I let the guys down," Turiaf said. Detroit has won four straight, while Los Angeles has dropped four of its last five games. The Lakers had a chance to end their skid at The Palace, but could not corral a key rebound before Prince made the game-winning shot. With 16 seconds left, Prince passed to Billups, who dished to  Rasheed Wallace , who missed a shot. The Pistons got to the offensive rebound and Prince was later open in the corner for a 3-pointer. "When another team gets an offensive rebound, it always seems that's the easiest time to hit a 3," Detroit coach Flip Saunders said. It was a disheartening way for the Lakers to start a nine-game road trip, where they will be challenged by a grueling schedule and short-handed roster. They dressed just 11 players, as  Luke Walton  (hip) was active but not in uniform with day-to-day status.  Andrew Bynum  (left knee),  Chris Mihm  (right ankle) and  Trevor Ariza  (right foot) were on the inactive list. "It's a tough loss because I felt like we had the game, but we made mental errors down the stretch," Bryant said. "But I'm encouraged and if we keep playing hard like this on the trip, we'll be all right." Detroit, which began a five-game homestand, had played 10 of the previous 14 games on the road. Los Angeles got off to a rough start, matching a season high with nine turnovers in the first quarter -- with Bryant contributing three of them -- as it fell behind 29-22. The Pistons built a huge lead in the second only to see it whittled to a seven-point advantage at halftime. Los Angeles took advantage of a disparity at the line, making 16 of 22 free throws while Detroit connected on both attempts in the first half. The Lakers finished with 35 free throws to Detroit's 16, leading to constant bickering from the Pistons' players and coaches that drew three technicals. "We were able to kind of get back into the game because of that," coach Phil Jackson said. Bryant took over in the third, scoring on an array of baskets inside and out to put the Lakers ahead. He did, however, surpass his previous career high in turnovers before the fourth started. Bryant made more clutch baskets in the final quarter, though, to make up for it and seemed as if he would finally beat the Pistons on their home court. But Odom's inbound pass went to  Kwame Brown , who got it back for Odom for a 19-footer that he missed long. "I kind of rushed it a little bit," Odom said. "But I'd take that shot all the time." Game notes  Kid Rock's guest at courtside was Run-DMC's Joseph "Rev. Run" Simmons. ... Bryant's previous career high in turnovers was nine, a total he reached Jan. 23 against San Antonio. ... Los Angeles beat the Pistons 103-91 on Nov. 16 at home. ... Hamilton and Billups were both called for technicals, arguing calls against them in the first half, and  Antonio McDyess  added another in the third quarter. ... Hamilton hurt his hip in the first half, but was able to return to the game. "Lamar kneed me on my hip and the ref called a foul on me," he said. "That's why I got a technical. It was killing me in the second half." ... As is his tradition, Jackson handed out books to each player and Odom received "Cinnamon Kiss," by Walter Mosley.
