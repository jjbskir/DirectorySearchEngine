ATLANTA -- A players-only meeting helped jump-start the  Atlanta Hawks . A visit from the  New Jersey Nets  also didn't hurt. Jamal Crawford  and the Atlanta Hawks used one of their best shooting nights of the season to end a four-game losing streak and beat the struggling New Jersey Nets 119-89 on Wednesday night. Crawford scored 29 points and  Joe Johnson  added 20 while sitting out the fourth quarter. The Hawks won easily one day after their players-only meeting, which followed a talk from coach Mike Woodson. Crawford said the players were not satisfied with their effort in the losing streak. "I think it was good. When you police yourself, coach doesn't have to always do it," Crawford said. The Hawks, coming off their worst offensive performance of the season, set a season high by making 13 3-pointers, including 10 in the first half. They made 57.3 percent of their shots from the field, just under their season-best 59.1 percent effort in a Dec. 2 win over Toronto. "I think every bit of adversity we've had all season we've bounced back from," Crawford said. "This was just the biggest bump in the road." Woodson said he was satisfied with his team's response to the losing streak. "I thought it was a great team effort across the board," Woodson said. "I thought our focus was there from beginning to end." The Nets missed their first 11 shots and never led while falling to 1-17 in road games. They have lost 13 of their last 14 overall. "We came out and we missed a bunch of shots right at the rim," said Nets coach Kiki Vandeweghe. "We got anything we wanted and for some reason the basket had a lid on it. And that just gave them tons of confidence. "Again, this is a very difficult time for us right now, where we're sort of stuck in mud and you've got to slug it out." Atlanta led 17-3 before the Nets' first field goal came on a 3-pointer by  Jarvis Hayes  with 5:54 remaining in the opening period. "We needed to establish ourselves early and that's what we were able to do," said Hawks forward  Josh Smith , who said the Nets are dangerous despite their 3-32 record. "If we don't get our confidence rolling, they're a tough team to beat," Smith said. Yi Jianlian  led New Jersey with 19 points and 11 rebounds.  Devin Harris  had 15 points and  Brook Lopez  added 12. "Nobody in this locker room is taking losing easy. No one," said  Chris Douglas-Roberts , who had six points. "We have to come back to life." The Hawks led 32-15 after the opening period. "We thought we would come out with better energy tonight, and we did, but we just took a quarter to do it," Harris said. "We came out with a better effort in the second quarter, but we just didn't start the game off the way we needed to. They kind of jumped on us." Guard  Chris Quinn , acquired by the Nets from Miami on Tuesday, entered the game with 7 minutes remaining and had three points and an assist. The Hawks avoided their first five-game skid in two years. They recovered from their worst offensive game of the season after being held to season lows in points and field-goal percentage (35.2) in Monday's 92-75 loss to Miami. Woodson and Smith drew technical fouls for separate second-quarter complaints to officials. It was Smith's seventh technical foul of the season. Smith had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists -- all in the first three quarters. "When he does what he did tonight, we're tough to beat," said Johnson of Smith. Marvin Williams  had 12 points and  Mike Bibby  added 10.  Al Horford , who had eight points and 10 rebounds, was Atlanta's only starter who did not score in double figures.
