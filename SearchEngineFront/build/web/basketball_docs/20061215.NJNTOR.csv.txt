TORONTO (AP) --  Vince Carter  played his worst game of the season in a hostile environment. Carter had a season-low 12 points against his former team in New Jersey's 90-78 loss to the  Toronto Raptors  on Friday night. T.J. Ford  had 17 points, nine rebounds and eight assists to lead the Raptors to their second straight victory without  Chris Bosh . Carter was booed every time he touched the ball. He went 4-for-17 from the field and 4-for-8 from the line for just 12 points. Fans derisively chanted Carter's name in the final minutes. He went 2-for-6 from the line down the stretch. The crowd of 19,973 was the ninth largest regular-season total in Air Canada Centre history. "I could care less," Carter said of the fans. "I can't get caught up in that. I've been playing ball too long for that to bother me. I hate it when my family yells at me more. That bothers me." Carter has played well against his former team. In his last game in Toronto, Carter capped a 42-point performance with a game-winning 3-pointer on Jan. 8. "It's not an easy situation coming back here. Vince has obviously played at a very high level and he just had a night where his shots weren't falling," New Jersey coach Lawrence Frank said. Ford had 10 points in the fourth quarter for the Raptors, who put six players in double figures while improving to 2-2 without their leading scorer, who has an injured left knee. "We know how to play without Chris now," Ford said. Hassan Adams  scored 13 points for the Nets, who played without  Richard Jefferson  (sore right ankle). Joey Graham  added 15 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors, who shot 45 percent compared to 39 percent for New Jersey. Jason Kidd  said the Nets can't just rely on Carter, who scored 36 points in his previous game and 37 in the game before that. "Vince loves coming here and playing, but he is human and we can't always expect just to sit back and hope he goes for 30," Kidd said. "Everybody has to do their part and he just had a bad game in his book." Ford said the Raptors made it tough for Carter by putting a lot of bodies on him. "He was the main focus. He was on an incredible streak this last week," Ford said. Ford scored 10 points in the final 6:45 as Toronto pulled away. Morris Peterson 's 3-pointer started a 10-3 run that was capped by Ford's jumper. Meanwhile, Carter went 1-for-4 from the line the final 3:36. The Raptors said in a release that Bosh will be out "an indefinite period of time until the swelling and discomfort has completely dissipated." Bosh injured the knee in Dec. 8 in Chicago and did make the trip to Florida for games against Orlando and Miami. The Raptors said he'll travel Sunday when they leave for a four-game west coast trip.
