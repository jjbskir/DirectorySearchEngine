SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The  Utah Jazz  took a page from the  Golden State Warriors  playbook, going with an uptempo offense. Deron Williams  scored 16 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter and the Utah Jazz beat the Golden State Warriors 133-110 on Saturday night. With the Jazz holding a six-point lead, Williams made seven of his final eight shots to turn the game into a rout. Utah's 133 points were the most for the team since a 133-124 overtime victory over Minnesota on Nov. 24, 1997. "I have been disappointed in my shooting effort, but I got a couple of easy ones and I got my confidence going," said Williams, who also had 11 assists. "I felt good out there." Al Harrington  led Golden State with 38 points on 15-for-20 shooting.  Kelenna Azubuike  added 17 points. Mehmet Okur  scored 28 points and  Ronnie Brewer  added 19 for the Jazz, who had seven players score in double figures. Williams hit four of the Jazz's 12 3-pointers. Utah was 12-for-16 from behind the arc. "D-Will had a fantastic fourth quarter,"  Carlos Boozer  said. "He got hot, Memo [Okur] got hot and I got hot too and we ended up shooting the ball really well." The Jazz built a 23-point lead in the third quarter before the Warriors rallied to 99-93 with 9:09 left in the fourth. "Unbelievable. I looked up and I thought we had a shot to win it," said Warriors coach Don Nelson. "We got within eight points with five minutes or so, and the next time I looked up, it was 18 points." Williams ended any hope of a comeback with his late-game shooting. "D-Will flourishes in this kind of a game," Brewer said. "He got us into a flow and we have an ability to score a lot of points when that happens." The Warriors started fast and led 20-9 on Harrington's dunk midway through the first quarter, but Utah closed the period on a 19-8 run to take a one-point advantage. The Jazz outscored the Warriors 36-18 in the second quarter to take a 19-point halftime advantage. It was the second victory for Utah over Golden State this season. The Jazz beat the Warriors 117-96 to spoil Golden State's home opener Tuesday night. "We're coming. We're coming," said  Baron Davis , who had 11 points for Golden State. "We just have to continue gelling. The Jazz really move the ball well as a team. They have a system and the system has worked for them for years." Game notes  The Warriors were missing  Austin Croshere  (back) and  Stephen Jackson  (NBA suspension).
