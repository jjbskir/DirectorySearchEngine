WASHINGTON -- The  Miami Heat  have had a bizarre week. Three nights after a 30-point win and two nights following a 39-point loss, they scored another lopsided victory. "I can't explain it. It's been happening all season," Heat forward  Michael Beasley  said. The Heat's worst losses this season have come in the second game of back-to-back games. After Friday night's 112-88 rout of the  Washington Wizards , it was only natural Miami was looking ahead, and not resting on an easy win. On Saturday, the Heat host Sacramento, and after a 1-6 record in those back-to-backers, coach Erik Spoelstra can't wait to see how his team plays. "It's about honesty and us being real with each other," Spoelstra said." What we've done on back-to-back nights so far, we have to be real about it, it's not been good enough." In those second games, the Heat have lost by 15, 29, 30 and 39. They're hoping to see more of what they got Friday night from  Dwyane Wade . The All-Star guard led Miami with 32 points.  Jermaine O'Neal  added 18 on an economical 8 for 10 from the field and Beasley had 15. Wade who scored 40 and 41 in two earlier games against Washington, had his way against a team full of problems. He was 12 for 19 from the field -- including four 3-pointers -- and had 10 assists. "You never expect to blow a team out in this league," Wade said. The Heat, despite all their ups and downs, are in much better shape than the Wizards, who lost for the sixth time in eight games. Washington was led by  Andray Blatche  with 19 points. A fifth-year player, he's regularly been criticized for his immaturity and was suspended for a game earlier this month for continually complaining that he hasn't had enough plays drawn up for him. "They came into our home laughing, dunking and just making it seem like we shouldn't be on the same court as them," Blatche said. "That should touch some people. It touched me." Antawn Jamison , who had just seven points in Wednesday's loss to Dallas, missed 10 of his 14 shots and was held to eight points. "They came out aggressive, knocked us in the mouth and we just stood there and took it," Jamison said. Intent on avoiding a second straight embarrassment, the Heat ended the first quarter on an 18-2 run to take a 32-15 lead and scored the first four points of the second quarter. After they had a 44-22 lead with 6:55 to play in the second quarter, Washington outscored them 14-2 to chop the lead to 46-34 with 3:11 to play in the quarter. Miami led 57-42 at halftime and had huge advantages in rebounds (26-15) and assists (15-5). Washington got within 10, at 61-51 with 8:42 to play in the third quarter, but the Heat outscored the Wizards 22-6 to take an 83-57 lead with 2:51 to play. Game notes  Two nights after missing 21 of 23 three-pointers, Miami hit a season-high 13 in 22 attempts. ... Washington coach Flip Saunders says that while Jamison deserves to be selected as a reserve in next month's All-Star Game, he probably won't. "Every year, there's 16 or 17 guys that deserve to be All-Stars," Saunders said. "If he doesn't make the All-Star team, it's not him individually, it's how the team has done." ... Miami F  Udonis Haslem  played in his 479th game, third most in Heat history. ... The Wizards led just once, but they didn't know it at the time. Foye hit a jumper that was ruled a 2-pointer that they thought tied the game at 10. Several minutes later after a video review, it was changed to a three-pointer. By then, Miami had regained the lead.
