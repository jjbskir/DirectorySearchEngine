SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah Jazz  forward  Carlos Boozer  couldn't contain his excitement while talking about Saturday night's 108-92 victory over the  Portland Trail Blazers . "We're just having so much fun right now," said Boozer, who had a team-high 26 points and 12 rebounds. "I just want to bottle this up and take it everywhere we go." Deron Williams  scored 24 points and had 15 of Utah's season-best 36 assists. The Jazz never trailed, shot 60.6 percent from the field and won for the fifth time in six games. "It was a good night for us offensively," Williams said. "We were hitting some outside shots and we were executing. We had confidence to take them and make them." Brandon Roy  scored 19 points and  LaMarcus Aldridge  and rookie  Jerryd Bayless  each added 14 for Portland, which lost for the second time in two nights. "I think we were a little fatigued tonight," Roy said. "Utah really just rushed it at us from the jump." Portland, which lost Friday night against Memphis, looked sluggish in the first quarter, leaving the Jazz with plenty of open looks. Utah shot 76 percent and took a 32-17 lead after one quarter. Ten of Williams' assists came in the first half as Utah built a 59-44 halftime lead. "We really passed the basketball," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "When you pass the ball and share with each other, it makes the game a lot easier to play." Utah shot 60 percent in back-to-back games for the first time since 1995.  Mehmet Okur  (12 points) and rookie  Eric Maynor  (10) also finished in double figures. The Blazers missed 15 of their 18 attempts from 3-point range. Utah played short-handed in the second half after forwards  Andrei Kirilenko  (lower back) and  Paul Millsap  (knee) left the game and did not return.
