"The defense started the offense and we did a good job all around," Davis said. "Our bench brought up the tempo in the fourth quarter and pumped up the energy. It was really big. Some nights, the big players are real factors and other nights, we have to step it up. Thats what the bench is for. We were able to get the lead with the other guys not on the floor. We stepped up at the right time." Richard Jefferson  led the Nets with 17 points,  Vince Carter  had 16 and  Josh Boone  added 14 and a career-high 16 rebounds.

"We just couldn't get anything going. We were right there in the fourth. We've got to get it done against the good teams. There are no excuses." Nets coach Lawrence Frank felt his team simply ran out of steam.
