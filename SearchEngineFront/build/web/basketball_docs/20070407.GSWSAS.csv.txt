 The Spurs defeated the Warriors, 112-99, in San Antonio; it was San Antonio's 19th consecutive home win over Golden State.  That matches the longest current streak of that type in the NBA; the Suns have been similarly inhospitable to the Bucks in their last 19 trips to Phoenix.  Elias Says 
 Golden State led 63-61 early in the second half, but the Spurs went on a 27-12 run to take a 13-point lead in the final minute of the third quarter. Ginobili hit all three of his shots in the third quarter, including two 3-pointers. "We battled and we got close, but we never seemed to turn the corner," Warriors guard  Baron Davis  said. "It seemed like we ran out of gas." Golden State trimmed the lead to nine points with 5:45 remaining in the game on Davis' 3-point shot. He was fouled, but missed the free throw. The Warriors then closed to 96-91 on Richardson's reverse layup with 4:55 left. But Duncan came back with a basket and free throw after being fouled by  Al Harrington . Harrington's pass on the next possession was stolen by Ginobili. Ginobili missed a 3-pointer as the 24-second clock sounded, but Duncan sailed through the air to get the rebound and jammed it through for a 101-91 lead with 3:54 left. "Once we got (close) there, we commit a couple of turnovers, they hit a couple of 3s and the next thing you know it goes from four to 10," Davis said. "A team like that, the closer the game gets, the margin for error for us is smaller." The Spurs outrebounded Golden State 62-46 and outshot the Warriors 52 percent to 42 percent from the field. It's the second straight game San Antonio has slowed a high-powered offense. The Spurs held the Warriors six points below their season scoring average. Two nights earlier, San Antonio held Phoenix to 15 points below its season average. "We played a great game two days ago," Ginobili said. "We had great intensity, great awareness, and I knew it was not going to be easy to maintain it. But it wasn't bad." Not only did Duncan lead San Antonio with a 12-of-17 night from the floor and 15 rebounds, he blocked four shots. "He was a horse all night," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "He was great inside." The Spurs (55-21) have won 19 straight games at home against the Warriors, a streak that dates to Feb. 14, 1997. They've won nine of 10 overall and are 20-3 since the All-Star break. The Warriors (37-40) also blew a chance to get to one game below .500 for the first time since they were 19-20 on Jan. 15. Golden State was nine games below .500 on March 4 after going 1-6 immediately after the All-Star break. Jason Richardson , who picked up three fouls in the first quarter, led Golden State with 23 points. Harrington added 22. Golden State was 3-for-3 from 3-point territory during the first 3:08, but San Antonio led 40-31 after one quarter. Duncan scored 17 points in the first half on 8-of-9 shooting from the floor, including a layup that made it 54-44 with 3:44 before halftime. But San Antonio missed five straight and the Warriors tied it at 54 when Richardson hit a 3-pointer with 1:13 left in the first half. Ginobili nailed a 3-pointer with less than 30 seconds remaining and Parker scored on a jump shot from just past the free throw line for a 59-56 halftime lead.
