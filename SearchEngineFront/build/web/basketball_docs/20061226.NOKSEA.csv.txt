SEATTLE (AP) -- Short of being a consistently winning team, the
 Seattle SuperSonics  have still found a way to turn their
oft-trashed home court into a house of horrors for opponents. Ankles had better beware. Luke Ridnour  had 27 points and nine assists Tuesday night to
lead the SuperSonics to a 102-94 victory over the limping New
Orleans Hornets, who lost rookie of the year  Chris Paul 
indefinitely to a sprained ankle in the first quarter. Last week, Dallas All-Star  Dirk Nowitzki  sprained his ankle on
the same floor at KeyArena -- but did not miss any games. Paul, the fourth Hornets key player now injured, is going to be
out at least two and perhaps four games, according to New Orleans
coach Byron Scott. "Right now we've got to re-evaluate the next couple days and
see if the swelling goes down," Scott said. "For sure, he's out
(Wednesday at Portland). And he'll probably be out the Denver game
(Friday in Oklahoma City), as well." Jannero Pargo  scored a season-high 23 points in his first start
of the season and former Sonic  Desmond Mason  added 21 for the
Hornets, who have lost six of their last seven games. Scott said his "best-case" scenario for Paul returning would
be for the Jan. 2 home game against Golden State. Paul refused
comment while awkwardly exiting the arena on crutches. Chris Wilcox  added a season high-tying 22 points for the Sonics,
who outscored New Orleans 30-22 in the decisive final quarter.
Wilcox said he, too, sprained his right ankle when crashing hard
into the basket standard while missing an alley-oop lay in late in
the game. "Put an ankle brace on it and it will be all right," for
Thursday's game at Denver, Wilcox said, describing what may become
pre-emptive player gear for future games in Seattle. Ray Allen  had 21 points and a season-best eight assists for the
Sonics, who won for the second consecutive time following a
six-game losing streak. Allen's 10 points led Seattle out of a 72-all tie after three
quarters. The All-Star was 3-for-4 in the decisive period, after
4-for-11 shooting in three quarters spent largely feeding open
teammates for scores. "We've been too individualistic on offense in the fourth
quarter. There's been no flow to our offense," said Allen. "That
really didn't happen tonight." His 3-pointer with 5:15 to go put Seattle back up 87-86. Allen
then converted a turnover by  Tyson Chandler  into a dunk by rookie
 Mickael Gelabale . Gelabale then swatted Chandler's shot underneath into the Sonics
bench. After Pargo briefly retied the game with a 3, Gelabale
followed his own miss to give the Sonics the lead for good, 91-89
with 3:50 remaining and end the French native's impressive spurt. Ridnour then swished a 3-pointer for his 11th make in 17 shots
to put Seattle up 99-91 with 1:20 left. That essentially ended the
game. Though beaten-down, the Hornets still had sting. They rebounded
from a 35-point home loss to San Antonio on Saturday by jumping to
a 10-point lead in the first quarter. New Orleans remained in front
or within four points of the lead after Paul got hurt -- until
Seattle's late surge. Paul had six points and seven of the Hornets' eight assists in
the opening period. He turned the ankle while landing his foot onto
the left foot of Seattle center  Johan Petro  in the open floor on a
Hornets' fast break with 1:18 left in the first quarter. Paul
hopped through the lane and then collapsed beyond the baseline
while screaming "Ohhh!" repeatedly and grabbing his ankle. After a few moments on his back, Paul was carried directly into
the nearby visitors' locker room by Chandler. The Hornets announced
at halftime that X-rays were negative. Without Paul -- plus injured  Peja Stojakovic  (back surgery),
 Bobby Jackson  (cracked left rib) and  David West  (right elbow) -- New
Orleans is missing 65 of the NBA-low 90 points it was averaging
entering Tuesday. Is it a silver lining that Paul may be back by next week? Nope,
Scott saw only more black. "There's never a best-case scenario with C.P. being out,"
Scott said. "Him missing a (single) game is going to hurt us,
obviously." Game notes Wilcox, who signed a $24 million, three-year contract in
August, had 10 rebounds for his fifth double-double this season.
... Scott uncharacteristically received a technical foul after
talking with an official coming out of halftime. After being
assessed the "T," Scott simply smiled at the referees and then
clapped to encourage his team. ... Chandler, the NBA's
fifth-leading rebounder at 11.7 per game coming in, had 11 rebounds
and 14 points.
