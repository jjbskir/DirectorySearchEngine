ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- At this point in the season, the Orlando
Magic will take lucky over good. Hedo Turkoglu  scored 18 points, including a fallaway 20-footer
with 0.4 seconds left, to lift the  Orlando Magic  to an 88-87
victory over the  Seattle SuperSonics  on Wednesday night. "That was a lucky shot," said Turkoglu, who was falling out of
bounds with  Rashard Lewis  draped all over him. "We should have won
that game easily but we were trying to do some fancy stuff and blew
the lead. We were lucky." Jameer Nelson  added 18 points and  Grant Hill  had 12 as the Magic
won their second straight game. Ray Allen  led Seattle with 21 points and Lewis had 16 as the
Sonics dropped to 1-4. "I feel frustrated and a little bit snakebitten," Sonics coach
Bob Hill said. "We did everything right just like we're supposed
to, except (Turkoglu) made the shot. We're going to win one sooner
or later. We just have to keep playing." Seattle had rallied from an 86-77 deficit in the final three
minutes to take an 87-86 lead on a layup by Lewis with 5.7 seconds
left in the game. However, Turkoglu took an inbounds pass from Hill and drilled
the game-winner over Lewis from the corner just before time
expired. That stopped a nightmarish three-minute stretch by Orlando
during which the Magic turned the ball over four times and missed
their only field goal attempt. Lewis scored five points, Allen hit a 3-pointer and  Chris Wilcox 
added a layup as Seattle ran off 10 straight points. The Magic hit their first six shots to jump out to a 13-0 lead
in the first three minutes against the Sonics, who lost in Miami on
Tuesday. Nick Collison 's three-point play put the Sonics ahead for the
first time, 28-27 with 8:53 left in the second period. Seattle
pushed the lead to 47-42 at halftime, scoring 20 points off
Orlando's 12 first-half turnovers. The Magic, who lead the NBA in turnovers, had 27 against
Seattle, including 10 in the fourth quarter. "The turnover thing is starting to get to me now," Magic coach
Brian Hill said. "You turn it over 27 times and you're going to
keep everyone in the game. We have to find a way to get out of
it." A 3-pointer by Allen gave Seattle its biggest lead of the game,
59-47 with 7:04 left in the third quarter. Nelson started the Magic comeback with a running 10-footer, two
of his 12 points in the period. Orlando outscored Seattle 20-8 the
rest of the quarter to tie it at 67 going into the final period. Seattle hit only two of its first 11 shots in the fourth quarter
and turned the ball over four times. "There are a lot of ways you can win and a lot of ways you can
lose and I think we've experienced them all," Allen said. "It's
painful to lose games like that, but we'll get right back up and
get on the horse again." Turkoglu's 3-pointer capped a 11-2 run that gave Orlando an
82-73 lead with 5:42 left in the game. A layup by Turkoglu made it
86-77 with 3:40 left. Game notes Magic backup PG  Carlos Arroyo  hit 18 of 22 shots (81.5
