DENVER (AP) -- It's not often  Earl Boykins  gets confused for
 Carmelo Anthony . Denver's diminutive point guard did his best Anthony
impersonation in the final quarter of the Nuggets' 117-108 win over
the  Washington Wizards  on Monday night.

 Camby It was Marcus Camby who stepped up in the absence of the suspended Nuggets starters, scoring 25 points with 17 rebounds, five assists, and seven blocked shots in a 117-108 win over the Wizards. Over the last 15 seasons, only three players attained totals that high in all four categories in one game: Hakeem Olajuwon (1995), Tim Duncan (1998), and Shaquille O'Neal (2000).

With Anthony,  J.R. Smith  and Nene all receiving suspensions
earlier in the day for their roles in a brawl against the New York
Knicks on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, someone needed
to step up. Especially after the Wizards trimmed a 30-point lead early in
the second quarter down to 93-91 with 5:36 left in the game. So Boykins accepted the role that's usually reserved for
Anthony. He scored 15 of his season-high 29 points in the fourth
quarter. "He gave us great energy off the bench," said  Andre Miller ,
who scored 27 points. Nuggets coach George Karl sounded almost prophetic before the
game when he talked about how the suspensions could have a
galvanizing affect on the team. He said it might be a good
opportunity for Boykins, who's been in a shooting slump, to regain
his form. Boykins hit 7 of 18 shots from the field, and none bigger
than a 3-pointer with 3:50 left to give the Nuggets a 102-91 lead. "There's going to be something good that comes out of this
nightmare," Karl said. Gilbert Arenas  doesn't think the Nuggets lose that much with the
suspension of Anthony, who started his 15-game suspension Monday
night. "They play better without Carmelo because the ball moves and
everybody goes," Arenas said. "They played well without him. It's
an emotional team right now. They will play hard. They are still a
good team." Marcus Camby  was simply listening to his own advice. Earlier in
the day he said everyone had to pick it up a notch. Camby scored a
season-high 25 points and grabbed 17 rebounds. "We were missing 50 points with J.R. and Carmelo," Camby said.
"We didn't just rely on one person to carry the load for us
offensively. Guys took it upon themselves to make the extra effort
and the extra pass to make the game easy for everybody." Denver accomplished something the  Los Angeles Lakers  couldn't
the night before -- slow down Arenas. A night after scoring a
franchise-record 60 points, Arenas was held to 23 against the
Nuggets. "We just tried to slow down Arenas some way," Camby said. "He
is one of the best scorers we have in this league." Karl isn't new to playing with a depleted lineup. He had to do
it all the time -- in the Continental Basketball Association when he
coached the Montana Golden Nuggets. "I'd lose a guy to the NBA, another to Europe and another would
just go home," Karl said. "You'd go from an eight-man roster,
three of your best players gone in one week, to bringing in three
new guys and rebuilding." That's what he's doing -- rebuilding on the fly. "I always thought my CBA experiences would be very good for
me," Karl said. "A couple of guys (Monday) said, 'Just coach like
you're in the CBA." For the first contest without Anthony and Smith, who's suspended
10 games, Karl will take it. Except maybe the lapse in the fourth
quarter, when the Wizards briefly made a game of it. "I think you saw a team that played with a lot of heart," Karl
said. "I think our team showed that no matter what happens we are
gonna play with pride and an attitude. You better be ready to beat
us. Washington scared us, but Earl made some big shots." That's what happens when called upon to fill in for Anthony. "I think this goes to show the depth of this team and the way
that guys stick together," Boykins said. "This was definitely a
team win." Game notes The Nuggets are now 3-7 all-time when Anthony doesn't play.
... Denver is 7-0 this season when it has scored 115 or more
points. ...  Yakhouba Diawara  made his first career start and scored
eight points. ... Arenas tied a season-high with eight rebounds.
... Nene was serving a one-game suspension for leaving the bench
area against the Knicks. He'll be back Wednesday against Phoenix.
