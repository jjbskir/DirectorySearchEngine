PORTLAND, Ore. -- The  Portland Trail Blazers  brought their high-scoring ways home with them. Brandon Roy  scored 22 points,  LaMarcus Aldridge  added 19 points and seven rebounds, and the Trail Blazers continued the offensive push that carried them through a tough road swing, cruising to a 102-79 win over the  Indiana Pacers  on Wednesday night. Rudy Fernandez  had 16 points, including five 3-pointers for Portland.  Andre Miller  added 12 and  Jerryd Bayless  had 10. The Blazers, coming off a 4-1 road trip, have scored more than 100 points in six straight games for the first time since Feb. 4-17, 1998. "It's a good sign," Portland coach  Nate McMillan  said. "To move the ball, set good screens, don't ball and fake the open man. We've got guys who can put the ball in the basket." Danny Granger  led the Pacers with 30 points. He got very little help on the offensive end.  T.J. Ford  added nine and  Dahntay Jones  had eight. Indiana second-leading scorer  Troy Murphy  was just 2 of 7 from the field and  Brandon Rush  made 2 of 9. The Pacers had 18 turnovers. "We turned the ball over way too many times," Murphy said. "Portland did a good job defensively, but we have got to give a better effort than we did tonight." The Pacers were even worse on the defensive end, particularly inside, where Aldridge made eight of 11 shots. Indiana has given up 100 or more points in 41 games this season and entered the game 24th in the league in scoring defense. Granger bounced back after a 2-for-9 shooting night in a 122-99 loss at the  Los Angeles Lakers  Tuesday night. An All-Star in 2008-09, Granger averaged 26.6 points in the previous seven games. Portland has been surging since Roy's recovery from a nagging hamstring problem, and with five wins in the last six games the Blazers have a tentative hold on the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference. "It's a favorable schedule for us down the stretch," Miller said. "We've talked about making up some of the home games that we lost. This is a good start. We need to get some rest, get in some practice and hopefully it will lead to a good March." Granger scored 12 in the first quarter and the Pacers led by as many as seven, but Aldridge hit his first four shots for the Blazers, and Bayless put Portland up 41-29 with a drive to the hoop. The Blazers led by as many as 15 in the second quarter, but Granger scored twice and Ford converted a runner to get the Pacers to 50-41 just before the half. The Blazers opened up a 57-43 lead before Indiana scored a point in the third. Fernandez hit a 3-pointer to put Portland up 79-59. "We didn't play as a team is the only thing I can say," Indiana center  Roy Hibbert  said. "We've been trying to figure it out all year." Game notes  Portland signed point guard  Travis Diener  to fill its 15th roster spot Wednesday. Diener was waived by the Pacers on Monday. He played in just four games this season and underwent surgery on his toe in November. ... The Blazers beat Indiana 102-91 on Dec. 9. They have swept the season series two years in a row. ...  Solomon Jones  didn't play for Indiana after serving a one-game suspension for unspecified conduct detrimental to the team.
