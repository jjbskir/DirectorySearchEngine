AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) --  Jason Maxiell  knows that he doesn't
have long to work his way up the  Detroit Pistons ' depth chart. Sunday night, with  Rasheed Wallace  sidelined by sore ankles,
Maxiell made his case. The second-year player finished a career night with the winning
shot in Detroit's 97-93 victory over the  Seattle SuperSonics . "Maxie isn't going to play 30 minutes a night when Sheed gets
back," Pistons coach Flip Saunders said. "But he will play. He's
earned that." With the score tied at 93, Maxiell took a pass from Chauncey
Billups and hit a 10-foot baseline jumper with 6.8 seconds to play. "Mr. Big Shot had the ball, so I wasn't expecting to get it,"
Maxiell said, referring to Billups. "I was about to go to the rack
when he dished me the ball." Billups said that he didn't think twice about putting the game
in the hands of a little-used reserve. "As great as Max played tonight, he deserved the chance,"
Billups said. "I gave him a crack at it. This is the type of game
where you learn a lot about young guys, and he got some respect." Maxiell had 17 points and 12 rebounds in 33 minutes, all career
highs for a player that some of the SuperSonics couldn't even
identify. "Max ... Mac ... Maxwell, whatever his name is, he outrebounded
our whole team,"  Rashard Lewis  said. "Every time I turned around,
he was coming out of nowhere. I don't think we put a body on him
all night." Maxiell helped the Pistons outrebound Seattle 54-32, including
26-7 on the offensive glass. "This game was about rebounding," Seattle coach Bob Hill said.
"They moved us right out of the way and Maxiell jumped over the
top." The SuperSonics tied it at 91 on  Mickael Gelabale 's layup with
59.2 seconds to play, but  Richard Hamilton  countered with a driving
bank shot in traffic. Tayshaun Prince  fouled Lewis at the other end, and Lewis' free
throws tied it with 28.4 seconds left, setting the stage for
Maxiell's shot. Seattle got one more possession, but  Carlos Delfino  tipped away
 Luke Ridnour 's pass, and Billups clinched it from the line. "We felt like we were in a position to win this game, so this
is very tough," Lewis said. "One guy just killed us." Hamilton finished with 24 points, and Billups had 21.  Dale Davis 
added 13 rebounds. "Dale looked like he turned the clock back 10 years tonight,"
Saunders said. "When he and Maxie are on the floor, the whole
identity of our team changes." Lewis led the Sonics with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Chris
Wilcox added 21 points. Detroit outrebounded the Sonics 29-14 in the first half, but led
only 51-50. Lewis kept Seattle in the game with 16 points in the
half on 7-of-9 shooting. Wilcox had 10 points in the first 8 minutes of the third,
helping Seattle go ahead, but the Pistons tied it on Hamilton's
four-point possession. He was fouled by  Nick Collison  while
scoring, and added a second free throw on Collison's technical. Hamilton's short jumper on the next possession put Detroit ahead
71-69, and the Pistons still had a 77-74 advantage going into the
fourth. Seattle tied it at 79, but Billups answered with back-to-back
3-pointers to give the Pistons a six-point lead with 8:51 left. Detroit only managed Billups' two free throws in the next 6
minutes, but played enough defense to keep the lead. Hamilton's
short jumper made it 89-85 with 2:48 left, but Seattle kept
coming. Game notes Detroit's 26 offensive rebounds were the most in the NBA
this season, and was one more than Seattle's defensive-rebound
total. ... Maxiell led the Pistons in scoring in the preseason, but
only played in 12 of Detroit's first 21 regular-season games. ...
Lewis hit his first six field-goal attempts, including two
3-pointers. ... Seattle rookie  Andreas Glyniadakis  saw limited
action in his first game against Detroit, which drafted in him in
the second round in 2003.
