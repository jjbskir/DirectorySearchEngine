OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --  Mike Dunleavy  got the best of his
father's team and even drew praise from his biggest critic: Golden
State coach Don Nelson. Dunleavy had 18 points and a season-high 13 rebounds and the
Warriors used a big fourth-quarter run to beat Mike Dunleavy Sr.'s
 Los Angeles Clippers  108-93 on Monday. Nelson called Dunleavy a "disaster" on opening night and
hasn't let up much since. But even Nelson was positive Monday,
saying Dunleavy played a "great game for us." "I wish he had tried to impress me that much the first 40
games," Nelson joked. In his first meeting against his father this season, Dunleavy
hit three 3-pointers in the second quarter, came up big on the
boards all game and helped the Warriors snap a three-game losing
streak by improving to 4-9 against his father. "It's nice at this point to beat anybody after the last two
games when we didn't play well," Dunleavy said. "Those were bad
losses for us and pushed us under .500. Against anybody it's nice,
but I guess against my dad it makes it a little better." Dunleavy, Golden State's $44.5 million backup forward, was
coming off a two-point game last Friday against Miami and has been
a disappointment this season. The fans have been on him all season
and even booed him when he went to the foul line during the 19-2
run that put the game away in the fourth quarter. "It's one of those things where a player should get booed if he
doesn't play hard, anything else ... you've got bad fans," Mike
Dunleavy Sr. said. The Warriors were extremely short-handed, dressing only eight
players for the game because of injuries to  Jason Richardson ,
 Mickael Pietrus ,  Adonal Foyle  and  Keith McLeod . Monta Ellis  led Golden State with 24 points,  Baron Davis  had 19
points and 13 assists despite shooting just 4-for-18 from the field
and  Matt Barnes  added 17 for the Warriors, who won for just the
second time in the last nine meetings against the Clippers. Elton Brand  led Los Angeles with 19 points and 13 rebounds,
 Corey Maggette  added 18 points,  Quinton Ross  scored 16 and Sam
Cassell had 15. After consecutive baskets by  Cuttino Mobley  to open the fourth
quarter gave the Clippers the lead, the Warriors went on the big
run to take control of the game. "I think it was a sense of desperation," Dunleavy Jr. said.
"They made a little run at the beginning of the first quarter and
we called a timeout. We realized that we can't let this one slip
away. For whatever reason, we were able to buckle down." Davis hit two free throws to start the spurt then stole the ball
near midcourt from  Daniel Ewing . Davis appeared to be on his way to
an uncontested dunk, but Ewing chased him down and made a
spectacular block. Barnes got the rebound and missed from in close
before Ellis scored on a tip-in. Davis hit two more free throws in the run and fed Andris
Biedrins and Barnes for baskets. Barnes' 3-pointer off a pass from
Davis capped the spurt. "It was the hustle opportunities they got," Brand said. "They
played hard. They had more energy going after loose balls. ... It
seems like every time we take a step forward, we're also taking two
steps back." The Warriors led by 11 early in the third quarter before Cassell
led the Clippers back. He scored seven points during an 8-0 run
that cut the lead to three. Golden State built the lead back to 10
before the Clippers responded with an 11-0 run that featured
another 3-pointer by Cassell. Golden State shot just 7-for-24 in the quarter and Ellis missed
all six of his shots but the Warriors still led 81-79 heading into
the fourth. Ellis kept the Warriors in the game early, scoring 14 points on
7-for-8 shooting in the first quarter to help Golden State take a
24-23 lead. The rest of the Warriors were just 4-for-17 from the
floor, including an 0-for-4 scoreless first quarter for Davis. Dunleavy took over the scoring load in the second quarter,
scoring 13 points to give the Warriors a 60-51 lead at the break.
The only thing that kept the Clippers in the game was Golden
State's poor foul shooting. The Warriors were just 7-for-17 from
the line in the half. Game notes Clippers G  Shaun Livingston  left the game in the third
quarter with a sprained right ankle. ...  Tim Thomas  missed the game
for Los Angeles with an ear infection. ... The Clippers are 1-15
when allowing at least 100 points this season.
