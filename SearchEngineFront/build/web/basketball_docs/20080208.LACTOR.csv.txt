TORONTO (AP) -- Even more short-handed than usual, the  Los Angeles Clippers  still had enough to hold off the  Toronto Raptors . Corey Maggette  matched his season-high with 35 points and went 5-for-5 from 3-point range,  Cuttino Mobley  had 19 and the Clippers beat the Raptors 102-98 on Friday night. Playing without suspended point guard  Sam Cassell , Los Angeles lost forward  Tim Thomas  to a sore back after the opening 12 minutes. "We've had a revolving door with our injuries, one to the next," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "We've got guys stepping in and playing hard. Every night it's been close. We're in games. It's just a matter of having enough gas to finish someone off." On this night, they did. Boosted after they took the lead on a Maggette 3-pointer late in the third, the Clippers didn't let up and held the edge all the way to the buzzer. "Usually we lose games like that but we weathered the storm and came out with a win," Maggette said. Al Thornton  had 19 points and  Chris Kaman  had 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Clippers, who had lost 10 of their previous 11 road games. "We executed the way we wanted to defensively and we came out with a win," Kaman said. Los Angeles has been without forward  Elton Brand  (torn Achilles) and point guard  Shaun Livingston  (torn knee ligaments) all season. The Clippers, who came in having lost six of eight overall, improved to 6-19 when Maggette scores 20 or more. "Corey had it going early," Dunleavy said. "We tried to ride that horse and he kept us consistent." Thornton scored nine in the fourth quarter while being defended by Raptors All-Star forward  Chris Bosh . "He's like our Energizer Bunny," Maggette said of Thornton. "When he comes in in the fourth quarter, he really takes over the game." Bosh finished with 29 points and 12 rebounds but fouled out with 12 seconds left as Toronto lost back-to-back home games for the first time since Jan. 6. "We just did not play good defense tonight," Bosh said. "Plain and simple, we can't win many games not playing good defense." Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said his team may have underestimated the Clippers, who are last in the Pacific at 16-31. "They deserved to win and we didn't deserve to win," Mitchell said. "We're not good enough to just look at a team's record and show up and play." Jamario Moon  had 16 points,  Andrea Bargnani  had 14 and  Jose Calderon  had 11 points and 14 assists as Toronto came out the loser in the franchise's 1,000th game. Toronto guard  T.J. Ford  got a loud ovation when he entered the game at the start of the second quarter, his first home appearance since a Dec. 11 injury at Atlanta. Ford returned to the lineup Feb. 4 at Miami following a 24-game absence. "The fans definitely made me feel good inside to know that I'm appreciated," Ford said. "They gave me a lot of boost and a lot of confidence." Moon's jumper gave Toronto a 68-56 lead at 7:33 of the third, but the Clippers got back into the game with an 11-2 run over the next three minutes. A 3-pointer by Maggette with 22 seconds left in the third gave Los Angeles a 78-77 lead heading into the final quarter. "That shot was a big shot," Maggette said. Their lead gone, the Raptors suddenly went stone cold. Bosh and  Carlos Delfino  each missed dunks and the Raptors didn't make another field goal until 6:22, when a jumper from Bargnani made it 89-83. A 3-pointer from Bargnani and a three-point play by Bosh made it 98-96 with 48 seconds left before Thornton missed a pair of free throws. Calderon hit the rim with a jumper and Bosh fouled out when he wrapped up Maggette, who made both his free throws to make it a four-point game with 12 seconds left. Toronto went 5-for-19 in the fourth. Thomas left after the first because of a sore back, the same injury that kept him out of Wednesday's loss at Boston. Thomas, who finished with three points, said his status for Saturday's game at Philadelphia remains in doubt. "I tried but it just wouldn't give in for me," Thomas said. "I've got to talk to the training staff and see what's going on. Game notes  Cassell missed the game as he served a one-game suspension, his penalty for a flagrant foul on Boston's  Rajon Rondo  on Wednesday. ... Los Angeles went 10-for-14 from 3-point range. ... The Clippers committed nine fouls in the second quarter, while Toronto was whistled for eight.
