ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Across the locker room from  Dwight Howard , three  Orlando Magic  players were arguing about their own All-Star contest. "I won 3-point shooting tonight," joked  Jameer Nelson , who was 5-of-5 from long range. "You made five?" said  Hedo Turkoglu , who was 7-for-11 on 3s. Turkoglu had 31 points and seven assists, and Howard had 24 points and 18 rebounds to help the Orlando Magic beat the  Philadelphia 76ers  115-99 on Friday night. Nelson and  Rashard Lewis  each had 17 points for the Magic. Andre Miller  and  Andre Iguodala  each scored 25 for the 76ers and  Willie Green  had 21 points. "I thought we played hard, but when you have guys hitting shots from all different parts of the court they are hard to guard," Miller said. Orlando was 15-of-33 from 3-point range, while the Sixers didn't make a 3 until less than 3 minutes left. They ended up shooting 3-for-13 from behind the arc. Orlando led comfortably all game -- most of it by double digits. But the Sixers put a late scare into the Magic with a 10-2 run over two minutes in the fourth quarter that made it 82-76. Iguodala scored six in the span, capping it with a steal and fast-break dunk that drew boos from the home crowd. The Magic answered with a run of their own -- 7-2 in less than a minute, including a 3-pointer by Turkoglu -- to effectively put the game away. It was a post-All-Star homecoming from Howard after winning the dunk contest last weekend. He was honored pre-game at center court with a trophy, and the arena played the "Superman" theme each time he made a big play -- homage to the jersey and cape Howard wore for the winning dunk. "It's crazy," Howard said. "But, you know, my focus is on just winning, playing defense, working on the things that we need to do so when we get to the playoffs we'll be ready." The 76ers never led, and Orlando was up 26-16 after the first quarter and 53-40 at halftime. "Tonight we played against a team that can throw it down and throw it out for threes," Green said. "That is what they did. They picked us apart." Game notes  Philadelphia closes a two-game road trip at Miami on Saturday, then hosts the Magic at home Wednesday. ...
