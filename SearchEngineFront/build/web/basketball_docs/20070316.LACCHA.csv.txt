CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Tim Thomas  told his  Los Angeles Clippers  teammates that they were thinking too much during a recent losing streak. Apparently he was right. Thomas came off the bench to score 24 points in the Clippers' 102-93 win over the  Charlotte Bobcats  on Friday night that snapped a five-game losing streak. "I told the guys before the San Antonio game [on March 13] to go out and play, don't put any added pressure on yourselves," said Thomas, who also had six assists. "When you go out thinking, you're always going to make mistakes. "But we're moving the ball now instead of holding it. Overall, our confidence as a team is high." Elton Brand  added 19 points and 10 rebounds, and four other players scored in double figures for the Clippers, who also won on the road for the first time in seven games. "This game was a pivotal game for us," said Clippers head coach  Mike Dunleavy , whose team is 9-23 in road games. "We had to have this win, and we have to get wins on the road." Corey Maggette  and  Cuttino Mobley  had 14 points apiece,  Sam Cassell  11 and  Chris Kaman  10 for the Clippers, who are 6-0 against Charlotte. "It was great balance," Brand said. "Guys are hitting shots ... and once Tim Thomas got open, he was knocking it down. That made it a lot easier for everybody." Raymond Felton  had 18 points for the Bobcats, who played without four injured starters: forward  Sean May  (sore right knee), forward  Emeka Okafor  (strained calf), center  Primoz Brezec  (sprained left ankle), and guard  Brevin Knight  (strained groin). Gerald Wallace  and rookie  Walter Herrmann  had 15 points each, and  Matt Carroll  finished with 13 for Charlotte, which led by as many as 10 points midway through the first quarter. The Bobcats hit 13 of 19 from the field (68.4 percent) in the first quarter to tie a franchise record for field-goal percentage, but went 19-of-59 over the final three periods in losing for the first time in their last three games. "We put ourselves in a great situation to be in the game, and a great situation to win the game," Felton said. "It just didn't fall our way. ... [The hot start] tired us out. No excuses. Shots weren't falling and they started hitting." Charlotte hit its first six shots and 11 of its first 12 to take a 24-14 lead on Carroll's layup with 5:30 left in the first quarter. "We had the tempo really nice, [and] made shots," Charlotte head coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. "[But] they started to run out at us because we were hot and we didn't take it to the hole." The Clippers pulled within five points at the end of the period, then trailed by a point three times in the second quarter before Cassell's free throw with 32 seconds remaining tied it 53-53 at the break. Thomas hit a 3-pointer with 8:46 left in the third quarter to put the Clippers ahead 60-59, their first lead of the game. "We had a big lift from Tim Thomas," Dunleavy said. "He kept us around until we got our bearings around us and executed better." After Wallace's layup with 7:52 left put the Bobcats back up 61-60, the Clippers broke loose on a 19-5 run, going ahead 79-66 on Cassell's jumper with 6.3 seconds left. The Clippers twice pulled ahead by 17 points in the fourth quarter, the last at 102-85 on Thomas' 3-pointer with 2:46 remaining. "We came out running and gunning," Wallace said. "We had them on the ropes, but the bodies that we had just kind of wore out. ... We did a great job with the limited guys we had. We kept ourselves close until fatigue set in." Game notes  Charlotte waived forward  Eric Williams  on Friday. Williams averaged 2.6 points in five games for the Bobcats after being traded by San Antonio on Feb. 13 for Charlotte center-forward  Melvin Ely  and the Spurs' second-round draft pick in 2009. ... Guard  Daniel Ewing , one of three former Duke players on the Clippers' roster, was disappointed in the Blue Devils' first-round loss in the NCAA tournament. "When tournament time comes, people expect Duke to be in the thick of things, regardless of the season they've had," said Ewing, who played at Duke between 2001-2005. "[But] everybody wants to see Duke lose. I'm used to it. I was there for four years. I know how it is."
