SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Bobby Jackson  turned back the clock a few years Friday night for the  Sacramento Kings . Jackson scored 18 points and  Kevin Martin  had 20 as the Kings built an early lead and cruised to a 98-86 victory over the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Friday night. A key contributor earlier this decade when the Kings were one of the NBA's premier teams, Jackson is nearing his 36th birthday and has mostly been used off the bench in his return to Sacramento. But with starter  Beno Udrih  out with a sprained ankle against the Clippers, Jackson made his fourth start of the year and played a season-high 37 minutes. He shot 6-of-8, hit three 3-pointers and also added four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. "I don't want any big minutes anymore," Jackson said. "My body feels better when I play 20 to 22 minutes. I had to pace myself a little out there tonight." For one of the few games this season, the Kings had control nearly the entire way. They led by nine points after one quarter, were up 13 at the half, and built the margin to a high of 24 points in the third quarter. Andres Nocioni  had 17 for Sacramento, which snapped a three-game losing streak and had lost 17 of their previous 19.  Francisco Garcia  added 15 points,  Rashad McCants  12 and  Jason Thompson  10, while  Spencer Hawes  had a career-high 15 rebounds. "When everyone is involved in a game like this, a blowout like this is a lot of fun," Hawes said. "It was good for us. In our situation, we really needed it." It was hardly a fun night for the Clippers, who had been playing well of late, beating Boston at home this week and winning five of their previous nine games. Although the Kings have the NBA's worst record at 13-47, they have beaten the Clippers three straight times this season. "They jumped on us,"  Baron Davis  said. "[Early] in the first quarter, they were playing into our hands. Then they went on that run and we were playing catchup ever since. We were not able to establish a lead and get a run." Steve Novak  and Baron Davis scored 13 points and  Zach Randolph  had 11 for the Clippers, who shot 38 percent. Injuries continue to be a problem for the Clippers, who played without standout rookie guard  Eric Gordon . He was the only Clippers player to appear in the team's first 58 games. "This is one of those games where we miss Eric Gordon," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "He is a very athletic guy that can attack off the dribble, create easy baskets for us and play good defense. He was getting close to 25 points before he got hurt." Recently acquired  Drew Gooden  did not play for the Kings after reaggravating a groin injury in the previous game. But the Kings did receive big efforts from both McCants and Nocioni, two of the team's seven new players. "I have been around enough losses [this year], but I definitely told the guys when we came in here that we have to take advantage of these wins," said McCants, who was traded by Minnesota. "We can't come in here and act like we lost another game. We need to cherish the win and hopefully tomorrow we will go to Utah and get another one." Martin scored 13 points and Nocioni had nine in the opening half when the Kings took a 52-39 lead. Jones scored nine points for the Clippers, who shot 35 percent. The Kings scored the final 10 points to assume a 27-18 lead after one quarter. Game notes  The Clippers waived point guard  Jason Hart , who played in 28 games this season. ... Acquired in a trade last week with Toronto,  Ike Diogu  played his first game with the Kings and went scoreless and had two rebounds in six minutes. ... The teams combined for only 30 free throws.
