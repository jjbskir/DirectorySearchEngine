SALT LAKE CITY (AP) --  Carlos Boozer  banged inside for his usual dunks and layups and even stepped outside for a few long jumpers. It didn't matter where he was. Almost everything Boozer put up went through the hoop as he led the  Utah Jazz  to a 127-113 win over the  Sacramento Kings  on Friday. "I tried to get layups first," said Boozer, who made his first 13 shots and finished with 33 points. "The net seemed huge to me, so when you go out there shooting jump shots you feel comfortable already." Boozer finished 15-for-19. He was perfect until the last second of the third quarter and his shooting overshadowed a pretty good night by teammates  Andrei Kirilenko  and  Deron Williams . Kirilenko had 25 points, six rebounds, six assists and four blocks and Williams had 16 points and 14 assists for the Jazz, who won for the seventh time in eight games. "We didn't do anything special. We just shoot in like different kinds of sets," said Kirilenko, who was 6-for-8. In addition to Utah's eighth straight win at home, Jazz fans got a bonus when Sacramento's  Ron Artest  was kicked out with two technical fouls in the fourth quarter. Fans booed Artest most of the night and cheered loudly when he was finally ejected. As the Jazz fans cheered, each of the Kings slapped Artest's hand on his way to the locker room. "Ron was out there fighting for everybody,"  Mike Bibby  said. "He was being physical back and they made him pay for it." The Jazz haven't won -- or even tied -- a season series against Sacramento since 2000. Friday's win gave Utah a 2-1 edge with one game remaining, so the worst the Jazz can do is tie. Kevin Martin  scored 32 points, making all 15 of his free throws, and Artest had 15 points and eight rebounds for the Kings. Artest missed the first meeting of the season with Utah because of a league suspension he was serving in November. Utah fans made up for the lost chance at booing Artest, who seemed to relish the negative attention as much as the fans enjoyed giving it. But he did start to show some frustration early in the fourth quarter and the Kings fell apart from there. Matt Harpring  tied up Artest under the basket and Artest flailed his arms wildly to get free. It happened again less than a minute later near the top of the key, and this time after breaking free of the armlock, Artest tried to get in Harpring's face. Harpring looked away and the officials got in between before anything could happen. Harpring was called for a foul and Artest got a technical after the officials called both coaches to midcourt for a conference. "If he wants to play that way, he's just going to ruin his game. That's what he did," Harpring said. "If he tried to bully me or scare me, it's not going to happen." The Kings never recovered after the technicals. "As much as I dislike it from this end, I appreciate that Harpring goes out there and gives up a couple of hard fouls," Sacramento coach Reggie Theus said. "That's the way the game should be played." Kyle Korver  made the technical free throw to give Utah a 106-93 lead. Later in the fourth, Harpring was called for an offensive foul and this time Martin started to go after him. Theus was called for a technical on that play and Korver hit the free throw again. Artest was close to getting another technical several times down the stretch, then got kicked out for a one-handed push toward Boozer with 4:34 remaining.
