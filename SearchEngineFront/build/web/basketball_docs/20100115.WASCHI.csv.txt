 "If I want to go a certain way and they play me a certain way, I got to spin and I got a nice little floater. ... I used to think about what move I'm going to make or whatever. I'm just letting it come to me right now." Just hours after suspended teammate  Gilbert Arenas  pleaded guilty back in D.C. to a felony gun charge, the Wizards put everything they had into getting a victory before falling short. Antawn Jamison  had a season-high 34 points and 18 rebounds,  Caron Butler  added 27 points,  Randy Foye  had 22 and  Brendan Haywood  grabbed a career-best 20 rebounds and scored 16. Both Butler and Jamison logged over 55 minutes. But Jamison said Arenas' problems had no bearing on the team's efforts Friday night. "It doesn't matter what's going on off the court. It just matters what's going on on the court," Jamison said. "It's tough to take anytime you lose a game. Off the court doesn't affect what goes on during game time. It doesn't affect us at all. We're out there playing hard, but we're just coming up short. Off the court distractions don't even come in this locker room when it's time to play the game." After Rose's basket over Foye and a timeout, it was Foye's turn. But he missed a shot from the baseline and Haywood got the offensive rebound just as the clock ran out. Kirk Hinrich  scored 19 points and  Joakim Noah  had 17 points and 15 rebounds for the Bulls. "They have gone through some difficult things in the last couple of weeks," Chicago coach  Vinny Del Negro  said of the Wizards. "Fortunately we made one more play than they did. It could have gone either way." Foye put the Wizards up in the second overtime with a jumper, but after a Washington turnover with 1:19 left,  Luol Deng 's basket tied it and Noah's free throw -- he was fouled on the play -- put the Bulls up one with 1:11 to go. After a Rose miss and foul on Noah, Haywood made 1 of 2 at the line to tie it again with 27 seconds left. In the first overtime, Foye's driving shot gave the Wizards a 112-110 lead with 41 seconds left. Rose lost the ball in the lane with 30 seconds to go and officials initially ruled it was Washington's ball before deciding to look at a video replay. They reversed the call, giving possession to the Bulls. And after the ball went out of bounds again off the Wizards,  John Salmons  drove for a basket to tie it with 14 seconds left. Foye missed a jumper with nine-tenths of a second to go, and following a timeout a pass to Rose under the basket was batted away by Jamison as the game headed to a second overtime. In regulation, Butler's jumper with 33 seconds left gave the Wizards a 104-102 lead, but Rose got the ball back after his initial shot was blocked and hit a tying jumper with 26 seconds remaining. After two timeouts, the Wizards inbounded, and after Foye held the ball while the shot clock ran down, he drove to the middle and lost it with Hinrich recovering for Chicago and calling a timeout with five seconds left. Rose's last-second jumper then went in the basket and came out, forcing overtime. "Somehow we pulled it out," Rose said. "We've been the type of team that would let it slip at the end. ... It shows how much we're improving." The Wizards showed early they weren't distracted by Arenas' plight. They moved the ball with crisp passes and used balanced scoring behind Jamison and Butler. Jamison had 17 first-half points and Butler 15, and the Wizards had a 29-22 rebounding edge as Washington took a 48-47 lead at the break. Nick Young 's 3-pointer at the third quarter buzzer kept the Wizards in front 77-74. Hinrich hit a 3-pointer and Rose made a jumper after an offensive rebound to give the Bulls a 100-99 lead with 1:29 left.  DeShawn Stevenson 's 3-pointer with just over a minute left gave Washington a two-point lead before Noah hit a pair of free throws to tie it with 54 seconds remaining. Game notes  The Wizards, who have lost four straight, now play six straight at home. ... The Bulls have won four straight and 8 of 11.
