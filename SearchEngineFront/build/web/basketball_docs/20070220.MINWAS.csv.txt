WASHINGTON -- Agent Zero left the locker room early, leaving
an opening for a teammate to seize the spotlight and claim a new
nickname: Mr. Fifty.
 

   
 Gilbert Arenas , trying his best to shoot himself out of a slump,
launched a few bricks and rattled a few home Tuesday night on his
way to 38 points as the  Washington Wizards  beat the Minnesota
Timberwolves 112-100.
 

   
Meanwhile,  DeShawn Stevenson  played a steady supporting role,
scoring a season-high 23 points on 9-for-11 shooting to raise his
field goal percentage to 50.1 percent. When the colorful Arenas
uncharacteristically dressed quickly and departed before reporters
arrived, Stevenson was more than happy to gloat at his teammate's
expense.
 

   
"He's 'Hibachi,' but I'm 'Mr. Fifty,"' Stevenson said. "Put
that in the newspaper so he'll get mad."
 

   
Stevenson, who also liked the idea of the nickname "Inspector
Fifty," then declared that the only teammates who can talk to him
are  Brendan Haywood  and  Etan Thomas , who happen to be the only ones
shooting 50 percent or better. Arenas is shooting a mere 42
percent.
 

   
"Because Gilbert, with his swag, I don't want to hear his mouth
all day, so that's the only way I could win," said Stevenson, who
is still smarting from losing to Arenas in a post-practice 3-point
shooting contest that has become a YouTube favorite. "He
definitely can't talk to me."
 

   
Arenas, who has struggled with his shot all month, started
passing up jumpers and relied on layups and free throws for most of
his points. He went 12-for-24 from the field and 13-for-15 from the
line but made only 1 of 8 from 3-point range -- including an air
ball -- and is 10-for-57 behind the arc over his last seven games.
 

   
"He started a little bit rusty," coach Eddie Jordan said.
"But he got going when we needed him."
 

   
Two people who were definitely talking Tuesday night were
Minnesota's  Kevin Garnett  and Washington's  Andray Blatche . Blatche
grew up idolizing Garnett and this was their first on-court
meeting. The second-year player was nervous but held his own, tying
a career-high with 12 rebounds while holding Garnett to a slow
start while the Wizards built a big first-half lead.
 

   
Kevin Garnett finished with 26 points on 8-for-17 shooting and
13 rebounds, but his night also included two traveling violations,
a palming violation and a technical foul for defensive three
seconds.
 

   
"He was trying to get in my head. There was some pretty good
trash-talking, but at the end of the game, he said, 'Good game,"'
Blatche said. "I am just excited to go home and watch the game
over and over again."
 

   
Asked about Blatche, Garnett said: "Next question." Instead,
Garnett talked about a slow first-quarter start that included seven
Minnesota turnovers, which he attributed to the All-Star layoff.
 

   
"What you saw was the vacation rest," Garnett said. "We
didn't take care of the ball. I probably had like three or four
turnovers myself. A little jump, eagerness. Once we got going, we
settled in and started to do some things."
 

   
 Caron Butler  added 15 points for the Wizards, who led from start
to finish to win their second straight and improve to 3-4 without
captain  Antawn Jamison , who will miss at least five more games with
a knee injury.
 

   
 Ricky Davis  scored 24 points, and  Mike James  added 20 for the
Timberwolves, who have lost five straight road games, part of a 1-9
skid away from home. Minnesota cut a 16-point deficit to four in
the third quarter, but couldn't sustain the momentum enough to
challenge for the lead.
 

   
"You got any ideas for me?" coach Randy Wittman said. "Don't
turn the ball over on the road. You've got to play better on the
road to put yourself in a situation to win. We're just not getting
it done."
 
 Game notes  It had to happen: Arenas' habit of yelling "Hibachi" when
taking a jump shot now has a promotional tie-in. During a
second-quarter timeout, the Wizards gave away an Arenas-autographed
hibachi grill to the fan with the best sign. ... Jordan offered a
timetable of 1{-3 weeks for Jamison's return. ... Need more
evidence of Jamison's importance as the team's locker room leader?
When Jordan was asked if he named an interim captain in Jamison's
absence, the coach said: "I sort of named somebody, but I forgot
who it was." ... Minnesota opens a season-long, five-game
homestand Wednesday against Charlotte. ... Thomas, who rejoined the
Wizards on Monday after a two-game suspension for punching Haywood
in practice, scored eight points in 23 minutes. ... The teams meet
again Sunday in Minnesota.
