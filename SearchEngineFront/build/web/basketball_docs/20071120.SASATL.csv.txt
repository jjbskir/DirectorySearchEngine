ATLANTA (AP) --  Tony Parker  helped San Antonio get a big lead and returned to the floor when the Spurs started struggling. Parker scored 17 of his 31 points in the second quarter and added nine assists,  Manu Ginobili  scored 19 and San Antonio beat the  Atlanta Hawks  95-83 on Tuesday night. "I was just trying to be aggressive," Parker said. "I was just trying to get in a rhythm." Parker went 7-for-9 from the field in the second and finished 13-of-20. He also went 4-for-4 from the free-throw line. "He did tonight what he does best," said  Joe Johnson , who led the Hawks with 20 points. "He had a bunch of layups. He pretty much goes where he wants to on the court." The Spurs (9-2) have won six of seven. San Antonio led 83-65 lead after three quarters, leading by 24 on several occasions, the last at 83-59 on a free throw by Ginobili. "We lost two important games against Phoenix and Dallas early in the season, so we knew we had to bring it for 48 minutes," Ginobili said. "We were just trying to be aggressive, get back on track." The Hawks went on a 14-2 run against mostly second-teamers to get within 85-75 with 6:45 left on a Johnson basket but never got closer. The Spurs took a timeout and got their starters back in. Baskets by  Michael Finley  and Parker got the lead back up to 89-75, ending a 6-minute drought in which they scored only one basket. "They had a heck of a comeback," Parker said. "We had a hard time to make a shot." Atlanta got within 10 again on a basket by  Marvin Williams  but San Antonio increased its lead to 95-81 on a pair of free throws by  Tim Duncan  and a basket by Ginobili with 2:23 left. "You can't chalk it up as just one of those days, because we turned it on late," Atlanta's  Josh Childress  said. "No, it's not a broken record. It's more like we have a little scratch on it." Atlanta has lost three straight. The defending NBA champion Spurs led 61-44 at halftime with Parker scoring 17 of his 21 first-half points in the second quarter. San Antonio's biggest lead of the opening half was 18 points on four occasions, the last at 58-40 on Parker's basket. The Spurs had five players in double figures. Duncan had 13 and  Fabricio Oberto  and Finley had 10 apiece. Game notes  Williams had a case of food poisoning Tuesday morning, but started and finished with 16 points. He said he got sick after eating pasta and crab meat Monday night. ... The Spurs outrebounded the Hawks 16-4 in the opening quarter with Duncan grabbing five for San Antonio. ... Hawks G  Anthony Johnson  got his second start of the season with guards Acie Law (sprained left ankle) and  Tyronn Lue  (groin strain) both out. ... Atlanta rookie G  Mario West  played nine minutes and fouled out with more than 11 minutes left in the game. "I still have a lot to learn. It happens sometimes, just being aggressive," he said.
