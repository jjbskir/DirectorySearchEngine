SALT LAKE CITY (AP) --  Matt Harpring  and the Utah reserves saw the beating the Jazz starters put on the  Indiana Pacers  right from the start. Then they came in and turned up the intensity another notch. Carlos Boozer  scored 22 points and Harpring added a season-high 16 to power the Jazz to a 111-89 victory on Tuesday night. "We did a good job being the aggressors tonight and we did a good job maintaining that throughout the game, especially defensively. Our defense was able to create the offense for us," Boozer said. The Jazz took a 28-point lead in the first half on their way to handing the Pacers their worst loss of the season. "Our second group played extremely well. Matt Harpring,  Jason Hart ,  Paul Millsap ,  [Kyle] Korver  -- those guys definitely did a great job," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "They executed the offense and passed the ball." The Jazz came out with renewed energy and exhibited defensive pressure in their 40-19 first quarter. "We got a lot of deflections, a lot of steals and we were very active, helping each other out defensively. That set the tone for us," Boozer said. Danny Granger  led the Pacers with 17 points and  Jamaal Tinsley , who saw Indiana go 1-4 while he sat out with a hamstring injury, made his return with 13 points. The Pacers have started their five-game Western Conference road swing with two blowout defeats after losing to the  Los Angeles Lakers  112-96 on Sunday. With 8:09 left in the second quarter, the Jazz had forced 11 turnovers and built a 50-22 advantage. "Our energy was definitely higher than it has been in a long time. We had 29 deflections by halftime, so guys were hustling," said  Deron Williams , who had 10 points and nine assists. For the Pacers,  Mike Dunleavy  made his five of his first six shots while the rest of the team shot 4-of-20. "We turned the ball over way too much and gave them too many easy shots," Dunleavy said. "We are going through a tough stretch right now and guys have got to persevere." The Pacers did for a time and the Jazz soon got sloppy, too. The Pacers scored the last seven points of the first half and the first four of the third quarter to trim the lead to 67-54 on  Troy Murphy 's jumper. Boozer scored eight points in a two-minute span, then Utah held Indiana scoreless for the last 4:11 of the third period to build a 90-66 lead entering the final quarter. "It certainly was no fun. Our guys never gave up but we just couldn't close the gap enough to make it a game," Indiana coach Jim O'Brien said. No Utah player played more than 26 minutes. The Jazz reserves used the extra time to record a season-best 54 points and Korver had 12 points as he reached double figures for the third time in four games since the trade from Philadelphia. Hart added 11 points. The Jazz began a four-game homestand and have won three of four games. That marks their best stretch since winning three in a row from Nov. 28 to Dec. 3. The Pacers, who were once two games above .500 at 15-13, have now dropped seven of their last eight contests and have lost six games in a row on the road. The Pacers had a season-high 26 turnovers which led to 28 Jazz points. The game was similarly one-sided to the Pacers' 117-97 win in Indianapolis on Nov. 17. "The Jazz are certainly improved from the first time we played them, especially in the intensity of their defense," O'Brien said. The Pacers trailed by as many as 32 points and passed their previous largest margin of defeat, a 134-114 loss to the Lakers on Nov. 20. "We got out in transition and made some easy baskets. We did it offensively in the first half but we also did it defensively. It felt good to be on this side of a blowout for a change," Williams said.
