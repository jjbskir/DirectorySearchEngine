PORTLAND, Ore. --  Greg Oden  took another step in his rookie progression with a second solid performance in less than a week. The 7-foot center had 18 points and 14 rebounds for the  Portland Trail Blazers  in a 100-87 victory over the  Washington Wizards  on Saturday night. "I've got to keep it consistent, keep it going," he said. "The next game, try to do it again. And the next game, and the next game, and the next game." On Monday, Oden had a career-high 25 points and 15 rebounds over the  Milwaukee Bucks . He had 10 points and 8 rebounds before fouling out against the  Cleveland Cavaliers  on Wednesday, but bounced back against the Wizards. Oden, the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NBA draft who's playing as a rookie after missing last season because of knee surgery, said it feels like he's getting closer. While some of his success may have to do with certain matchups opposing teams present, the confidence Oden gains from big nights will lead to more consistency. "We want to see Oden stretch out and be a force and I thought tonight he showed us that," coach  Nate McMillan  said. Oden, however, was only truly satisfied with one aspect of his night against the Wizards. "I'm satisfied that we won," he said. Portland led by as many as 22 points.  Brandon Roy  scored 22 points and tied a franchise high with 10 steals. Caron Butler  had 31 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards, who have lost nine of 11. "I thought we could have done better as a group," Butler said. "When our guys come in, we have to realize no one is feeling sorry for us." The injury-depleted Wizards, who have been playing without All-Star guard  Gilbert Arenas  and center  Brendan Haywood  all season so far, lost 117-97 loss to the  Los Angeles Lakers  on Thursday night. They didn't fare any better against the Blazers. Portland went up 19-8 early, but the Wizards were surprisingly resilient.  Juan Dixon  hit a 3-pointer to close Washington to 22-20, before  Darius Songaila  tied it with a jumper. The Wizards could not pull ahead, and the Blazers responded to with a 12-2 run, capped by  Travis Outlaw 's jumper, to make it 36-24. Portland went into the break with a 39-31 lead, despite shooting just 31 percent (13-of-42) from the floor. The Wizards shot 35.3 percent (12-of-34) and had 14 turnovers. Oden had 12 points and 10 rebounds in the first half alone for his 13th double-double this season. His back-to-back dunks in the third quarter put the Blazers ahead 57-40. Roy's tip-shot made it 66-44. "They never gave us a sustained run, and whenever we made a run, they would respond and come back, turn us over, and get something good," Washington head coach Ed Tapscott said. Portland was coming off a 104-98 home loss to Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. It was their third loss in five games.
