LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The  Los Angeles Lakers  were able to win
without Kobe. Now they've won with him. Kobe Bryant  made his season debut with 23 points,  Lamar Odom 
scored 28 and Los Angeles remained unbeaten with a 118-112 victory
over the  Seattle SuperSonics  on Friday night. The Lakers won their opening two games while Bryant worked his
way back from the arthroscopic surgery he had on his right knee
during the offseason. "I feel pretty good. I wasn't thinking about the knee that
much," said Bryant, who seemed to be moving as well as usual on
the court. "It's exciting to be back. I am happy to be out on the
floor. "The timing and rhythm was off but that will come back in time.
In the first half I jumped off the leg for a reverse layup. That
was something I didn't do at all last year." Ray Allen  had 30 points and  Rashard Lewis  added 28 for Seattle
(0-2). Bryant played 41 minutes and went 8-of-15 from the field. He had
six assists and four rebounds. Odom made five free throws in the closing 36 seconds to help the
Lakers hold off the Sonics.  Luke Walton  had a career-high 20 points
and eight rebounds for Los Angeles. "Having Kobe back, watching Ronny (Turiaf) come up big in the
end, that was awesome. That was a lot more fun for me than having a
career high in points," Walton said. The 28-year-old Bryant, an eight-time all-star who led the
league in scoring with a 35.4 average last season, missed all the
Lakers' exhibition games this fall. Without Bryant, Odom had 34 points and 13 rebounds in a
season-opening win over Phoenix and 22 points in the second
victory, against Golden State. "The guys worked extremely hard in the offseason," Bryant
said. "To step up when we needed them at the beginning of the
season is great." The Sonics led 102-100 with 4:55 left in the game. But Turiaf's
two free throws pulled the Lakers even, and he added a jumper for a
104-102 lead shortly afterward, and Los Angeles didn't trail again. Seattle coach Bob Hill was unhappy with the disparity in free
throws. "It's difficult to win a basketball game when one team (Los
Angeles) shoots 48 free throws and your team shoots 16 and you go
to the basket for two-thirds of the game," Hill said. "That's
very difficult to overcome." He was particularly displeased that  Chris Wilcox  didn't get a
call late in the game. "We were down by four with 30-something seconds left to play
and we wanted to go two-for-one with a chance to win the game.
Wilcox just got knocked," Hill said. "The Lakers grabbed his arm
and just knocked him on his back. "That's wrong and we earned the right to get a foul on that
play. I just can't believe that Wilcox didn't get a free throw on
that play." Allen hit a jumper, was fouled by Bryant and made the free throw
to draw the Sonics even at 77-77 with 4:07 left in the third
quarter. Down 33-13 nine minutes into the game, the Sonics chipped
away at the lead and pulled within 50-48 with 4:44 left in the
second quarter. Los Angeles led 65-56 at halftime. <
