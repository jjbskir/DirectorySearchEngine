"It feels like I might be able to have a choice in doing something tomorrow, other than just recover," he said. "Maybe I'll go to the mall or something."

   Bosh accomplished plenty in his limited time. And so did the Raptors. Coming off an overtime victory in Washington on Friday that snapped a five-game losing streak, Toronto had it easy this time. The Raptors led 37-16 after the first quarter, with Bosh again leading the way after scoring 31 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in the night before. He had 13 points in the opening quarter alone and hit nine of 12 shots overall as Toronto sent Chicago to its seventh loss in eight games. "The last couple of games we saw everybody helping each other, everybody telling everybody if you make a mistake it doesn't matter," said guard  Jose Calderon , who played 19 minutes because of some groin pain and the lopsided score. "Somebody will help you. It's no problem at all." One night after getting danced on by  LeBron James  and the  Cleveland Cavaliers  in a 101-87 loss, the Bulls never could get going against the Raptors. They shot 39 percent against a team that was next-to-last in opponents' scoring and gave up 146 points in a loss to Atlanta earlier in the week. John Salmons  and  Jannero Pargo  scored 13 apiece to lead Chicago, while  Brad Miller  added 11. Luol Deng  finished with nine points after averaging 20 in his previous six games.  Derrick Rose  had nine points and five assists, and  Joakim Noah  had another frustrating night after jawing with the dancing James in Cleveland. This time, Noah directed his anger toward officials, resulting in technical fouls in the first and third quarters and an early exit, and that did not sit well with Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro. "He has to control his emotions," Del Negro said. "We've talked about this, not just with Joakim, but with other players. He has to understand how important it is that he is on the floor with us." Even so, the Bulls had checked out of this one long before Noah's ejection. "I feel like on Monday or something like that, we've got to go back to school or something," Rose said. "I feel like that right now. Tomorrow is an off day, get treatment or whatever and come back the next day, have a strong practice and we'll be fine." Bosh set the tone, scoring on a layup and swatting one by Rose in the opening minute of a dominant first quarter that saw the Raptors build a 21-point lead.  DeMar DeRozan  added all of his 11 in the period, including an alley-oop from Calderon, and the Raptors converted 12 of 21 shots. The Bulls, meanwhile, kept settling for jumpers and were 5 of 17. Throw in six of their 14 turnovers and it added up to one of their ugliest quarters this season. "We have a chance to be a good defensive team," Bosh said. "It's just all about effort and work." Game notes  The Raptors hit 23 of 26 free throws. ... Del Negro didn't notice the Cavaliers carrying on Friday, but he did like seeing Noah stand up to a superstar. "I was happy for Joakim," he said. "I thought it was the right thing. Everybody was feeling the same way, I think. But we have to play better and not put ourselves in that situation." ... The Bulls continue to take a cautious approach with G  Kirk Hinrich , who missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left thumb. "He wants to be out there," Del Negro said. "It's an unfortunate injury." ... Pargo, who has a hip and back problem, shot 5 for 15.
