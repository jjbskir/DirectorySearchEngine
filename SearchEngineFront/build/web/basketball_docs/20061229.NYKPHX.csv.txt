explanation for the Knicks' 108-86 loss in Phoenix on Friday night.

 Lee David Lee has pulled down at least 13 rebounds in each of his last seven games. Over the last 35 seasons, only two New York players have had a streak of that kind: Bob McAdoo in 1977-78 (eight straight) and Patrick Ewing in 1994-95 (seven).  For more Elias Says,  click here 
 
 
 "They're just better than we are right now," he said. "They
have a beautiful basketball team, the way they move, the way they
pass, the way they cut. They're good. One day the goal is to try to
get to that kind of level of play." Steve Nash  and  Raja Bell  scored 20 points apiece to lead six
Suns players in double figures in the team's 20th win, but just
their second in the past four games. Phoenix, a 101-99 loser at Dallas on Thursday night on Dirk
Nowitzki's shot with less than a second to play, blew open a
21-point lead in the first quarter and the Knicks never got it to
single digits after that. Leandro Barbosa  scored 16,  Shawn Marion  14,  Kurt Thomas  12 and
 Amare Stoudemire  11 for the Suns, who play at Detroit on Sunday. "I think after last night's game we definitely could have had
an emotional letdown," Nash said. "We came out with a lot of
energy defensively. We made some shots and gave ourselves a lead to
manage." Jamal Crawford  scored 21 for the Knicks.  Eddy Curry  added 19
points and 10 rebounds.  Channing Frye  had 12 points. With his scoring output, Nash became the 39th player in NBA
history to top 10,000 points and 5,000 assists in his career. He is
the sixth active player to reach the mark. One of those six,  Stephon Marbury , scored 14 points on 5-for-17
shooting for the Knicks, who had won four of five since their Dec.
16 melee against Denver. "They've got great shooters all over the court," Marbury said.
"With Amare picking and going to the basket, you've got to help.
Steve Nash plays the pick-and-roll so well, and he sees the floor
so well." Frye's 17-footer cut the lead to 78-67 with 43 seconds left in
the third quarter, but Bell made a 3-pointer seven seconds later
and Phoenix led 81-67 entering the fourth. Bell sank three more
3-pointers in the fourth quarter to ensure the blowout. "Again, a game we should have won. We did what we're supposed
to do," Phoenix coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We're playing well.
We're just moving right along. It's too bad about last night, but
these guys snapped back and we've got a road trip coming up and
we'll see what we can do." The Knicks shot 26 percent (5-for-19) and had 10 turnovers in
the first quarter, and Phoenix led 34-14 after one. "We got in their passing lanes, had some great defense, limited
them to one shot," Marion said. "They had a lot of turnovers. We
were stopping them. I think that shows a lot about what we're
capable of doing." Even though the game was sandwiched between matchup against
Dallas and Detroit, there was no Phoenix letdown. "Our guys don't do that. Steve Nash doesn't do that," D'Antoni
said, "and I think we understand the importance of winning games
you're supposed to win." The Suns had a 19-4 run in the quarter to go up 32-11 on Thomas'
17-footer with 1:12 left. Thomas came off the bench when Stoudemire
got two quick fouls to 10 points in the first quarter on 4-of-5
shooting. New York cut it to 45-30 on Crawford's 8-foot runner, but
Barbosa scored five in a 7-0 spurt that put Phoenix up 52-30 with
3:22 left in the half. The Suns led 56-39 at the break. The Knicks shooting climbed to 34 percent by halftime, compared
with 50 percent for Phoenix. New York was 0-for-7 on 3-pointers in
the first half, the Suns 6-for-14. Game notes All four NBA teams with 20 wins are in the Western
Conference. ... Ex-Sun  Quentin Richardson  sat out the game with
back spasms. He has yet to play against Phoenix in the three games
with the Knicks since he was traded to New York for Thomas before
last season. ... Curry had 15 points on 6-for-9 shooting in the
first half. The rest of the Knicks were 10-for-38. ... New York's
five-game trip is its longest of the season. ... The Suns are 34-4
at home against Eastern Conference opponents since Nash joined the
team in 2004. Two of those losses were to Washington, the latest
just last week.
