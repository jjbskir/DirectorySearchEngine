PHILADELPHIA --  Rasheed Wallace  keeps making his hometown his stomping ground. Wallace rooted on the Phillies at Game 5 of the World Series and he popped by to watch Philly boxing great Bernard Hopkins train for an upcoming bout. Boston's top reserve didn't stop having fun just because it was time to play. Wallace hit six 3-pointers as part of a 20-point effort and the Celtics remained unbeaten with a 105-74 victory over the  Philadelphia 76ers  on Tuesday night.

 "It's home," Wallace said. "A lot of friends and family don't get the opportunity to see me play. Everybody can't get that league pass and all that stuff. It's always fun to come back here and play." Wallace, who wore a black Phillies jacket to the game, easily had his best game in his short stint with the Celtics. He pretty much caught the ball, let it rip and watched it sink through the net. Wallace made 6 of 8 3-pointers and sank each long attempt about as easily as a layup in the paint. Wallace was about the only Celtic who had his normal night, even getting whistled for a technical foul for arguing with the refs in the third quarter. His fuse burst late in the quarter when he appeared to be fouled on a shot. The ref called a foul, he just didn't call it a shooting foul and denied Wallace a trip to the free-throw line. Wallace kept badgering the refs over the perceived blown call until he was hit with the T with 4.5 seconds left in the third. "I just wanted to get my point across," Wallace said. "I wasn't going to get thrown out." Paul Pierce  scored 21 points as the Celtics improved to 5-0 even without the usual standout performances from  Kevin Garnett  and  Ray Allen . "We're going to win because of our defense no matter how good our offense is," Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  said. Allen didn't score his first field goal until the third quarter and had five points. Garnett made just one basket on seven shots and scored three points when he was yanked with the game out of hand. By the time Wallace got his technical, the game had spiraled into a blowout. Allen scored his first basket and Pierce hit a 3-pointer in a 14-2 run to open the quarter that shook off the Sixers for good. Eddie House  made four 3s off the bench for the Celtics and scored 12 points.  Shelden Williams  added 11 points, helping the Celtics bench to a productive night after the starters and Wallace made this one a rout. Boston went 14 for 20 from 3-point range. The Sixers failed to hit a 3 until  Jrue Holiday  made one with 1:28 left in the game. The basket only cut Boston's lead to 102-71. Andre Iguodala  led the Sixers with 17 points. Philadelphia missed 15 of 16 3-point attempts. Thaddeus Young  was the only other Sixer in double digits, scoring 11 points as they snapped their modest two-game winning streak. The Sixers have struggled in two losses against the elite teams in the Eastern Conference (Orlando, Boston). "They are veterans and we know they know how to play together," Young said. Wallace, friends with Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, didn't offer a World Series prediction. The Yankees hold a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. "We've got the bats for it, we've got the pitching for it," Wallace said. He was also smart enough to stay out of Hopkins' way during an afternoon visit at a local boxing gym. Hopkins, who attended the game, will fight Enrique Ornelas in a light heavyweight bout on Dec. 2 at Temple's Liacouras Center. "Nah, I didn't get in the ring with him this time," Wallace said. "He's got a fight coming up and I didn't want to damage him or nothing." Instead, he saved his blows for the 76ers. Game notes  Rivers said he did not expect to hear from the NBA over a postgame incident in Boston involving New Orleans guard  Chris Paul  and the Celtics'  Rajon Rondo . Rondo didn't want to talk about it. ... The Celtics swept the season series (4-0) last season. ... The biggest cheer came for Phillies World Series highlights.
