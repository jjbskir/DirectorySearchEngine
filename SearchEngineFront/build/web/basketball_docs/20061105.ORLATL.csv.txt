ATLANTA (AP) -- The long-suffering  Atlanta Hawks  make no
apologies as they relish life in first place in the Southeast
Division. The Hawks never trailed in their 95-82 win over the Orlando
Magic Sunday, and with the win Atlanta moved over .500 for the
first time since 2002. It's only three games, but for the long-suffering Hawks, any
winning record -- even 2-1 -- is notable. "I know it doesn't mean nothing, but it means a lot to us,"
said Hawks forward  Josh Smith . The Hawks have posted seven straight losing seasons and haven't
made the playoffs since 1999. The last time they were over .500 was
when they were 6-5 in late November in the 2002-03 season. "They're a good team," said Orlando's  Jameer Nelson . "They
are primarily the same team, but when you keep the core of a team
together, you're going to get better." Joe Johnson  scored a game-high 31 points, helping Atlanta
overcome Orlando's size advantage. Johnson is continuing to emerge
as a top scorer after spending the offseason with the USA World
Championship team. "Joe is Joe; he's special," said Hawks coach Mike Woodson.
"You're going to see a lot more of that. I truly believe what he
went through this summer, experienced with that Olympic team,
seeing what that level of game was all about, man, he's come back a
different player. He wants to win. He's trying to make everyone
around him better." Johnson is averaging 28.7 points through three games. "We have another year under our belt," Johnson said. "We're
maturing as a team ... coming out and working hard every night. It
feels good to get off to a good start." Orlando (1-2) recorded only eight assists, matching a
franchise-low, as it lost its first road game of the season. "It's very disappointing, the effort that we came out here with
from the beginning of the game," said Orlando coach Brian Hill.
"I'm extremely disappointed in everybody's effort, with the
exception of  Grant Hill ." Atlanta point guard  Speedy Claxton  is still returning to playing
shape after missing most of the preseason with a broken hand, and
that has prevented the Hawks from maintaining their up-tempo style
for extended stretches. Even so, the Hawks started fast in building
an early lead. Zaza Pachulia  scored 17 points and Josh Smith added 11 points
and 11 rebounds as the Hawks won their second straight home game. Carlos Arroyo  returned after missing one game with a strained
right hamstring to lead Orlando with 22 points, including 13 in the
final quarter. Arroyo also led Orlando with three assists. Grant
Hill added 14 points. The Hawks led 46-35 at halftime after holding Orlando to 11
points in the opening period. Orlando's superior size began to wear on the Hawks in the third
period.  Dwight Howard  went to the free-throw line on three straight
possessions after he drew two fouls on Shelden Williams, forcing
the rookie to the bench with four fouls, and another on Smith. The Magic continued to push the ball inside. Following a
three-point play by  Tony Battie , a basket by  Hedo Turkoglu  with
6:24 left in the quarter pulled Orlando to a 50-50 tie. There was
another tie at 53-all, but the Magic never led. Orlando pulled to within 77-73 before  Josh Childress  scored on
consecutive possessions, followed by another set of back-to-back
baskets by Johnson for an 85-73 lead. The Magic's frustration showed when Howard was called for his
fifth foul on Pachulia with 1:35 left. Howard then drew a technical
foul for slapping the ball at Pachulia following the call. "You try not to get frustrated with the referees and just try
to keep working and play hard, but we kind of got away from that
today," Howard said. "Our energy level wasn't what we needed it
to be today, so that's the reason we lost." Howard was held to 11 points and eight rebounds after averaging
20.5 points and 10 rebounds in the first two games. Game notes Orlando also recorded only eight assists at Golden State on
Nov. 16, 2002. ... Williams was 0-for-9 from the field for the
season before banking in a shot over  Darko Milicic  with 1:17 left
in the first half for his first career field goal. ... The Hawks'
other rookie, F Solomon Jones, scored the first six points of his
career.
