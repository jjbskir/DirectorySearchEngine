 The Hornets were playing without their two best interior defenders --  Tyson Chandler  and  David West  -- and were left with only  Melvin Ely  and  Ryan Bowen  to defend one of the best young post players in the game. If it sounds like a mismatch, it was. Jefferson had 24 points and 14 rebounds and Minnesota controlled the paint in a 116-108 victory over the Hornets. "They had their big guys out, so we knew to attack the basket," Jefferson said. "Guys did a good job attacking the basket." Randy Foye  had 24 points and eight assists and  Rodney Carney  scored 12 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter for Minnesota. The Timberwolves scored 52 points in the paint against the league's best post defense and held a 42-26 rebounding advantage to improve to 8-2 this month, tied with Orlando for best in the NBA. James Posey  had 24 points and tied a career high with seven 3-pointers for New Orleans.  Chris Paul  added 23 points and 12 assists. New Orleans was able to overcome the absences of Chandler (left ankle) and West (back) down low against New Jersey on Wednesday, but not on this night. New Orleans entered the game allowing 34.1 points in the paint per game, the fewest in the league. But Minnesota had 28 in the first half alone and outscored New Orleans 20-9 in second-chance points. "It showed we missed our two big guys," Hornets coach  Byron Scott  said. "They just killed us on the boards. They were much more physical than we were." Craig Smith  had 15 points and  Mike Miller  had 12, most of which came on drives to the basket. Paul ran the pick-and-roll to devastating perfection in the first three quarters. When he wasn't knifing to the basket for layups and fouls, Paul was dishing to center  Sean Marks , who hit all five of his field goals in the first half. New Orleans shot 56 percent and led by as many as 12 points in the first half, and had an 81-79 lead going into the fourth. But the Hornets lost for just the second time in 26 games when they've either led or been tied going to the fourth quarter. Marks missed all four of his shots the rest of the way and the Wolves put a lid on Paul in the fourth. "They killed us on the boards," said Hornets forward  Morris Peterson , who scored all eight of his points in the first half. "A lot of times when you get beat that bad on rebounding you give up second chance points and you get less chances to score. When you take those two factors in it was a tough one for us." Carney opened the final period with a jumper and a 3-pointer, then had a thunderous dunk and another 3 in an 8-0 run that put the Wolves up for good with 4:45 left. Looking like the big-shot maker he was for the Celtics during their run to the title last year, Posey hit three 3-pointers in the fourth to keep the Hornets in it. The last one cut Minnesota's lead to 101-99 with 3:31 to play, but Foye responded with two huge 3-pointers in the final two minutes to put the game away. "The biggest thing is (Posey) made those shots, but we still didn't keep our heads down," Foye said. "We kept playing. We got back on defense. We scored on them. And then we stopped them."
