It was the first victory at the Palace of Richardson's NBA career. He grew up about an hour north of Auburn Hills before starring at Michigan State. "I've been in the league for six years and I finally got one," he said. "We've got everyone healthy and we aren't giving up." The win also ended Golden State's seven-game road losing streak, and gave the Warriors a lopsided sweep of the season series. They beat Detroit 111-79 at home on Nov. 11. "We should have been ready for this," Pistons coach Flip Saunders said. "They beat us by 30 out there, and we played the same way again tonight." The Warriors had lost 11 straight at the Palace since a 91-88 victory on Nov. 28, 1993. "We need to take this as a positive and let this game change our season," said  Stephen Jackson . "There's still time to get this turned around." Detroit was missing  Rasheed Wallace  (left foot) for the third game in a row, while the Warriors got Jackson (turf toe) and  Baron Davis  (knee) back. "It's good to have Baron and Jackson back," Golden State coach Don Nelson said. "They are my two best defenders, so having them on the floor working together is a delight to see." Al Harrington  had 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Jackson finished with 14 points. Six Warriors reached double figures as Golden State became the first team to score 100 points against the Pistons since Feb. 6. "I don't know if the force was with us tonight or if we just played pretty well," Nelson said. "We made shots and that always helps." Lindsey Hunter  scored 20 points for Detroit, matching his total as a Pistons rookie in Golden State's 1993 win at the Palace, while  Tayshaun Prince  had 18, but the Pistons were helpless against Golden State's shooting. Richard Hamilton  finished with six points on 2-of-4 shooting -- his first single-digit game of the year. "It says a lot when Rip only takes four shots in 27 minutes," Saunders said. "I've seen him take four shots in two minutes and seven seconds before, but in 27?" The Pistons led by seven with 3 minutes left in the first half, but Golden State finished the second quarter with a 15-2 run, including seven points from Richardson, to take a 61-55 edge. The Warriors shot 57.5 percent in the first half, including a combined 9-for-9 from  Andris Biedrins  and  Matt Barnes . "We had the game under control, but we started throwing lobs and running and playing their game," Saunders said. "We let them get going, and they didn't miss a thing in the rest of the game." Golden State didn't cool down during the break, hitting seven of its first nine third-quarter shots to take a 78-61 advantage. All five starters had already reached double figures before the midpoint of the quarter. The Warriors ended up shooting 52.6 percent in the period, getting nine points from Jackson, and held an 88-71 lead going into the fourth quarter. Game notes   Jason Maxiell  and Davis picked up second-quarter technicals for a bit of trash-talking. It was the first technical of Maxiell's two-year career. Moments later,  Chauncey Billups  and Saunders each got technicals for arguing a call ... Richardson was cheered during pregame introductions, but he was booed after he and Davis stopped on an uncontested fast break to set up an elaborate alley-oop play. ...  Chris Webber  also played in Golden State's last win in Detroit. As a rookie for the Warriors, playing in his first NBA game in his hometown, he injured his ankle in the first minute and missed the rest of the game. ... Hunter hadn't scored 20 points since doing it in back-to-back games in December 2002 for Toronto.
