DENVER (AP) -- No  Dirk Nowitzki . No problem for the Dallas
Mavericks in extending their winning streak to 10 games. "Everybody knew Dirk was out of the lineup," Dallas forward
 Josh Howard  said. "We needed some people to pick it up and not
just me." Howard had 28 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Mavericks to
their 10th straight victory, 89-85 over the  Denver Nuggets  on
Sunday night. "I was trying to stay aggressive," Howard said. "But it was
more of a matter of me going out there and playing my great game." Howard has scored 20 or more points in 10 of his past 17 games
while averaging 23 points. "This is the top," Dallas coach  Avery Johnson  said. "We could
easily have found an excuse for this game, but these guys are
playing some tough, hard-nosed basketball." Howard had nine points in the fourth quarter and made a key
basket in the last minute.  Jason Terry  scored nine of his 21 points
in the final period for the Mavericks, missing Nowitzki because of
a sinus infection. Allen Iverson  had 28 points and eight assists for Denver, and
 Earl Boykins  added 20 points.  Marcus Camby  had 13 points and 13
rebounds in his first game back after missing four games because of
a broken finger. "I sat out the last four games," Camby said. "I felt like I
couldn't miss anymore time." Dallas outscored Denver 26-16 in the fourth quarter. "This one was hard to take," Iverson said. We had it. We had
the game and didn't finish it out." Terry connected on two short jumpers in the opening minute of
the fourth quarter, getting Dallas to 69-67, but the Nuggets
regrouped to go ahead 72-67 after  Eduardo Najera 's layup and 76-69
on Najera's follow with 7:35 remaining. "The Nuggets had our backs to the wall at that point," Johnson
said. "But we just wouldn't let ourselves buckle." Dallas tied it at 79 after Terry's 3-pointer and a jump shot by
Demean George with 5:08 left. Camby gave Denver its last lead, 82-81 with a free throw with
2:32 left and  Devin Harris  gave Dallas the lead right back with a
jump shot with 2:16 remaining. Boykins and  Yakhouba Diawara  missed badly on 3-point attempts on
Denver's next two possessions, while Erik Dampier and Howard were
converting two free throws each to make it 87-82 with 1:16 left. Iverson hit two free throws for Denver, but Howard buried a
15-foot shot with a minute left to put Dallas ahead 89-84. Najera
had a free throw for the game's final point. The Nuggets have blown six fourth-quarter leads this season. Denver opened the second half with two jumpers by Iverson to
lead 54-44 before Howard started an 8-0 run to get Dallas to 54-52
with 8:15 left. The Mavericks remained close until Terry's jumper
made it 62-61, but Iverson hit four three throws as part of a 7-2
run in the final 3:08 of the third quarter for a 69-63 lead. "Tonight we would have won a 40-minute game, but these games
last 48 minutes," Denver coach George Karl said. "I've got to
find a way to win these games until we get everyone back." <
