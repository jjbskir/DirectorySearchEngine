MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) --  Mehmet Okur  found his range with the game
on the line. Okur, who had missed his previous four shots from outside the
arc, scored 20 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 36
seconds left, and the  Utah Jazz  beat the  Memphis Grizzlies  100-97
on Saturday night. "I was open. It was a good play," Okur said. "(Deron
Williams) drove inside hard, and he just made a good play for me." Okur entered the game shooting 63 percent from 3-point range. "I don't know what happened," Okur said. "But I didn't give
up. I have confidence in my shot, and so do my teammates. I knew it
was coming for me." Okur added a pair of free throws with 2.5 seconds as Utah scored
the game's final eight points to erase a 97-92 Memphis lead with
2:27 left. The Grizzlies thought they had tied it when  Damon Stoudamire 
banked in a 3-pointer as the horn sounded, but officials ruled it
came too late, sending Memphis to its ninth loss in the last 10. "I was just trying to get it out of my hands," Stoudamire
said. "I really wasn't paying attention to whether I got it off in
time or not. I knew time was going down." The final play, in which Stoudamire struggled to get off the
shot, was representative of the Grizzlies' problems in the final
minutes. There were other miscues and defensively, Memphis failed
to get out on Okur or  Andrei Kirilenko , who connected on a
3-pointer to start the final 8-0 run. "Utah executed down the stretch when they had to," Memphis
coach Mike Fratello said. "We had a couple of breakdowns
defensively, and on offense, we had a couple of turnovers down the
stretch. They did a good job of making us pay." Carlos Boozer  led the Jazz with 24 points and 11 rebounds, while
Williams finished with 17 points and nine assists.  Derek Fisher 
scored 11 points, and reserve  Ronnie Brewer  added 10. Mike Miller  led Memphis with 28 points, while  Dahntay Jones  had
14.  Pau Gasol  finished with 12 points. "At the end of the day, it's still a loss," Miller said.
"We've got to learn how to win games, and that's the bottom line.
We're playing good enough to win. We're just not doing it and
that's disappointing." Memphis, which averages 19.3 points in the first quarter, got
off to a good start, connecting on seven of its first nine shots,
building an 18-5 lead midway through the opening period. But the Grizzlies also ended up with foul problems, then
shooting problems, missing 11 of their next 14 shots, allowing Utah
to pull even in the second. The Jazz sat several starters, including Kirilenko and Okur,
through much of the second period, and Memphis was able to rally
for a 48-45 lead at the half. Miller led the way with 14 points for
Memphis, while Boozer scored 11 for Utah. "I thought in the first half, we were selfish," Utah coach
Jerry Sloan said. "In the second half, we did a much better job of
forcing the offensive rebounds and passed the ball better." There was plenty of banging, with players ending up on the deck
and a steady stream of fouls called in the first half. That seemed
to affect the play of Gasol, who still is limited to about 25
minutes as he recovers from a broken left foot. At times, either
because of the physical play or a lack of conditioning, Gasol was
slow getting back on defense, leaving Utah players open for easy
baskets inside. The teams exchanged leads midway through the third period before
the Grizzlies took a 78-75 advantage entering the final quarter. Memphis built the lead to as many as eight early in the fourth,
but Utah stayed close until Okur's 3 gave the Jazz their first lead
of the period. "He's hit a ton of those, and I don't have a problem with him
shooting them," Sloan said. "I like it wherever he shoots from,
but Deron was the one who found him open. Game notes Kirilenko did not record a block, stopping his streak of 28
straight games with a block. Memphis had a season-high 10 blocks,
while Utah had none. ... The game was the last in a five-game trip
for the Jazz, who went 3-2. ... Memphis was without F Stromile
Swift, who left the team to return home to Louisiana after his
mother had a stroke. ... Sloan drew an early technical for arguing
with official Ed Malloy with 7:24 to go in the first period.
