TORONTO -- George Karl called the  Toronto Raptors  the most talented team in the Eastern Conference after his  Denver Nuggets  missed their first 15 shots and lost by 27. Morris Peterson  had 23 points,  Jorge Garbajosa  had a career-high 22 and the Raptors never trailed in a 121-94 victory over Denver on Friday night. "I'm really impressed by this team. They might have the best talent in the Eastern Conference," Karl said. "Their eight or nine guys know how to play. Detroit has probably the best starters in the league, but this team has great players. They have a chance to be a great team." Karl likes their unselfish style. T.J. Ford  had 14 points and 14 assists for the Atlantic Division-leading Raptors, who led by as many as 38. Toronto won its second straight without No. 1 pick  Andrea Bargnani , who is out after having an appendectomy Wednesday. All-Star  Chris Bosh  agreed with Karl's assessment and said the great thing is that this is the first year the core has been together. "It's very nice to hear," Bosh said. Bosh didn't return after spraining his right ankle after landing on Denver's  Reggie Evans  midway through the third. Toronto led by 32 at the time. Bosh didn't appreciate Evans being under him. "If you don't jump to contest a shot there's no reason to step toward somebody," Bosh said. Toronto's  Rasho Nesterovic  later gave Evans a bloody mouth with a forearm. Nesterovic received a flagrant foul. He said you have to watch Evans sometimes. Evans said he was "extremely" angry about getting hit. "For him to swing like that and have his fist balled up, that let me know he did it on purpose," said Evans, who watched a tape of it after the game. "The tape doesn't lie. He had his fist balled up, he's swinging." Evans said he didn't mean to hurt Bosh. "If they think I did that on purpose what can I do about somebody thinking like that? I know deep down inside I ain't doing nothing but hooping," Evans said. Carmelo Anthony  had a season-low 10 points for the Nuggets, who never recovered after missing their first 15 shots. Denver lost by one in Chicago on Thursday night. Anthony -- second in the NBA in scoring -- finished 3-for-15 from the field.  Allen Iverson  had 14 points on 3-for-12 shooting. "We talked about trying to hold Carmelo and A.I. to a certain amount of points, but never in my wildest dreams ... ," Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said. The Raptors began the game on a 12-0 run, led by 21 after the first quarter and 29 at halftime. Toronto scored 72 points in the first half, a season-high this season. Garbajosa reached a career high by halftime with 21 points, one more than his previous best March 14 versus New York. He went 5-for-9 from beyond the arc. Toronto shot 57 percent compared to 38 percent for Denver. The Raptors ended a five-game losing streak to the Nuggets, beating them for the first time since Dec. 30, 2003. Nesterovic capped an 11-2 run with three-point play, giving Toronto a 38-point lead with 9:10 left in the third quarter. Game notes  Denver center  Marcus Camby  missed the game with back spasms. ... Bargnani has been released from the hospital. "He's going to be out as long as it takes," Toronto coach Sam Mitchell said. "He needs to get rest and recuperate." ...
