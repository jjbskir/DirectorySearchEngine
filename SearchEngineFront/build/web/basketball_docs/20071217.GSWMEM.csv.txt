MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Golden State weathered an early Memphis offensive flurry and a late rally to turn back the Grizzlies. Stephen Jackson  had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and  Monta Ellis  added 23 points to help Golden State end a three-game road losing streak with a 125-117 victory over Memphis on Monday night. The victory overshadowed 32 points from Memphis forward  Rudy Gay , the second consecutive game in which he has surpassed 30. Memphis lost its fifth straight at home despite missing only one of its first 10 shots. "It was a game of swings," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "We got the first punches in, and they came back with more punches and got more of them in." Baron Davis  finished with 22 points and eight assists, and  Al Harrington  added 17 points.  Kelenna Azubuike  scored 15 for Golden State. Mike Miller  finished with 20 points and seven assists for Memphis, while  Kyle Lowry  contributed 18 points.  Juan Carlos Navarro  scored 17 points, and  Stromile Swift  finished with 13. The Warriors appeared in control as they maintained a double-digit advantage through the midway point of the fourth quarter. But Memphis began connecting from long range with a 3-pointer by Navarro, and a pair by Miller. Gay connected on two free throws to get Memphis within 113-107 with 3:07 left. But Memphis was unable to get closer than five in the closing seconds. "At the end of the game, we started clock-watching, and they started hitting shots," Jackson said of the Grizzlies' final spurt. "The only thing bad about this game was we didn't finish the game like we should have." Golden State coach Don Nelson added: "We had a few letdowns in the fourth quarter, but other than that, the best team won." The Grizzlies still were without leading rebounder and second-leading scorer  Pau Gasol , who missed his third game with a jammed right big toe. Starting center  Darko Milicic  also aggravated a nagging left ankle injury and played less than nine minutes. The absence of the two 7-footers left the Grizzlies to go with a smaller lineup. Memphis, which entered the fourth hitting only one of its 16 shots outside the arc, connected on 8-of-13 from long range in the final period to make it close down the stretch. "We just couldn't find a way to stop them, and our 3s were ice cold," Iavaroni said. "When you spot them a lot of threes, even though you catch up in the last quarter with a flurry of them, you are playing catch up ball. We couldn't get enough stops at the end." Most expected the game to be a high-scoring affair because the Warriors have the second-highest scoring average in the league and allow more points than anyone else. Memphis is among the top 10 scoring teams and surrenders more points than any other team except Golden State. But when it was time to make stops, the Warriors executed down the stretch. "With our style of play, we're going to give up a lot of points," Davis said. "But at the same time, we can knuckle down when it's time. We start getting in the passing lanes and start scrapping. That's our makeup." Game notes  Grizzlies rookie G  Mike Conley Jr.  indicated before the game that his injured right shoulder is improving, and he could return in a couple of weeks. He hasn't played since injuring the shoulder against Dallas on Nov. 17. "Hopefully, the doctor will clear me for contact practices and make sure I'm ready to do that," Conley said. "Hopefully, it will come sooner than later. I'm feeling pretty good right now." ... Davis is the only Warriors player to start all 25 games. ... After the starting lineups were announced with Azubuike at guard, Nelson came to the scorer's table to say that Ellis, from Jackson, Miss., would start. Jackson is about 200 miles south of Memphis. ... The Warriors were playing the second game of a season-long five-game road trip. ... The Warrior are 13-5 with Jackson in the lineup. Jackson's 12 rebounds tied a season-high. "About 10 of them fell right in my hands," Jackson said. "So, I can't really take too much [pride] in that."
