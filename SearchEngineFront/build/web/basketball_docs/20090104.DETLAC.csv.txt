 "You know you're having a bad-shooting game when you get the game-winner -- and that don't even go in," Iverson said after going 7-for-22 from the field and finishing with 18 points and 10 assists. "Finally, I got an easy shot that I knew was going in to put us up by one point, and somebody comes out of nowhere on a goaltending. It was so loud, so at first I didn't know they had called it." Iverson made a pair of 3-pointers in the second quarter, ending an eight-game drought in which he was 0-for-8 from behind the arc. But he missed his other five 3-point attempts against the Clippers. "All day I got some great looks and a lot of those shots felt good, but they just didn't go in," Iverson said. "I think it goes all the way back to grade school when the coaches tell you to just stay with it and stay positive regardless of what's happening in the game. I guess just being a veteran helped me out today." Rodney Stuckey  scored 24 points and  Tayshaun Prince  added 20, helping extend Detroit's winning streak to seven games in a matchup of injury-depleted teams.

Rookie guard  Eric Gordon  scored a career-high 31 points for the Clippers, but missed a 15-footer over Prince as time expired. "Eric was hot all night. It's just too bad his last shot didn't fall," Thornton said. "Things like that happen, and a loss is a loss. so we can't carry that through to the next game. A win would help rebuild our team chemistry and develop a more winning mentality." The Clippers dropped to 8-25 with their seventh straight loss.  Marcus Camby  had 14 points and 20 rebounds, extending his double-digit rebound streak to 20 games. He is averaging 18.3 over his last eight.

The Clippers tied it at 80 with two free throws and a short jumper by Gordon that capped a 10-2 spurt with 2:56 remaining. But the Prince spun around  Mardy Collins  for a dunk and Iverson hit a 20-footer from the key 32 seconds later, giving Detroit an 86-82 edge with 1:20 left. Gordon, the Clippers' No. 1 draft pick, responded with a driving layup before Iverson missed a 15-foot fadeaway jumper with 41 seconds to go.
