MILWAUKEE -- The  Houston Rockets  have dealt with constant trade rumors about  Tracy McGrady 's next stop. The swirling chatter is new for the  Milwaukee Bucks , and they didn't handle it well on the eve of the trading deadline. Trevor Ariza  hit a career-high six 3-pointers, scoring 22 points, and the Rockets hit 16 shots from beyond the arc to rout the Bucks 127-99 on Wednesday night. "It will be nice when the deadline passes and we can settle in for the stretch run," said Rockets forward  Shane Battier , who was 6 of 6 from 3-point range and finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. "If they make a move, OK, these are our guys moving forward. There's something comforting about that." Houston snapped a three-game losing streak, scoring a season-high 127 points and shooting a season-high 57.5 percent from the field. The Rockets were one off the franchise record for 3-pointers, set in 1999 against Toronto and tied in 2001 against Milwaukee. Houston went 16 of 23 from beyond the arc. "Once you hit one or two, the basket gets real big," Ariza said. "Anything you put up you feel like you're going to make. That's what I felt like at least." Just before halftime, several reports said the Bucks had traded for  John Salmons  from the  Chicago Bulls , a shooting guard who would be due a little over $5.8 million next season as part of a player option. Officials with the Bucks would not immediately confirm a deal had been reached, and a team spokesman said no trade would be announced on Wednesday night. "Nothing I can comment on right now," Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  said. The Bucks returned to the court in the second half and shot just 33 percent. Bucks center  Andrew Bogut , who finished with 12 points and seven rebounds, said all the talk has been a distraction. "It's no secret, we know which guys are rumored in trades," Bogut said. "You don't want (it) to distract the team but human nature says you've got guys that probably aren't going to be here tomorrow or the day after." Rookie  Brandon Jennings  scored 13 points to lead the Bucks, but scored Milwaukee's first nine points before going to the locker room with an uncontrollable cough. He returned a few minutes later without the same shooting touch. Houston outscored Milwaukee 43-14 in the third quarter, turning a 57-52 halftime advantage into a 100-66 blowout.  Aaron Brooks  scored 15 points and had 12 assists, and  Carl Landry  chipped in 19 points for the Rockets. Battier got Houston's second-half 3-party started and Houston hit 7 of 8 from behind the arc at one point, using spurts of 14-2 and 18-0 in the quarter. "(We) just shot the lights out in the third quarter," Rockets coach Rick Adelman said. "Shane and Trevor were just on fire. It was a well-needed win for us. We really needed it because we've been so up and down." Houston's eight 3-pointers in the third were the most 3s in a quarter for the franchise since knocking down nine on March 8, 2008, in the second quarter against New Orleans, according to STATS, LLC. "We definitely deserved to lose tonight," Bogut said. "We struggled to score; we struggled to defend." While it appeared the Rockets might be the active team on the day before the 3 p.m. EST trading deadline with McGrady yet to be moved, Milwaukee was the one caught up in rumors. "The only thing that has been an issue at all is the fact that you make a deal for Tracy, it probably involves a couple other people," Adelman said. The Bulls are seeking salary cap relief for next year's free agent class while the Bucks have several expiring contracts available to deal. Bucks general manager John Hammond has said he'd make a trade to take on a longer contract if it made sense, and the Bucks have only four players currently under contract in 2011-12. "It's a business and you've got to be ready," said Bucks forward  Hakim Warrick , who didn't play and has had his name come up several times in recent days. "You wonder no matter what whenever you come around this time of the (season). ... It's tough, but no matter what, you've got to stay focused and be ready." Game notes  Houston has won 10 of the last 11 against Milwaukee. ... Warrick is one of Milwaukee's expiring contracts along with  Luke Ridnour ,  Kurt Thomas ,  Joe Alexander ,  Jerry Stackhouse  and the injured  Francisco Elson .
