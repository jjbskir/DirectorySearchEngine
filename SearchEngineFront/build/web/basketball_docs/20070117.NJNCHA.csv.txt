CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Crack-a-Collins nearly cost the  New Jersey Nets  a win. Vince Carter  scored 26 points and had two big baskets late in the fourth quarter as the Nets overcame poor free-throw shooting by  Jason Collins  to beat the  Charlotte Bobcats  92-85 on Wednesday night. Jason Kidd  added 17 points for the Nets, who saw a 23-point third-quarter lead sliced to seven after going nearly five minutes without a point. The Nets couldn't score in part because Bobcats assistant John-Blair Bickerstaff -- who took over as head coach when his father Bernie was ejected -- decided to repeatedly foul Collins, a 55 percent free-throw shooter. The Hack-a-Shaq-like strategy nearly worked. Collins shot 3-of-10 from the line in the fourth quarter -- and one of the makes was banked in. "I see it as an opportunity to get on the scoreboard," said Collins, who was in good spirits as teammates razzed him the locker room. "I look at it as free points. They tried to help my average. "It's not like I don't practice. I take at least 200 free throws a day. It's a matter of making them in the game." Carter bailed him out. His reverse layup and fadeaway jumper from the baseline put the Nets ahead 87-78 with 3 minutes left. New Jersey survived 12 missed free throws in all to win for the seventh time in nine games. "Vince stepped up in a big way when we were struggling and had a great sense for the moment," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. New Jersey cruised early against the undermanned and poor-shooting Bobcats, who were without three key players and then lost Bernie Bickerstaff to a second-quarter ejection. But Charlotte, with a mismatched lineup that included little-used  Ryan Hollins , fought back under the guidance of John-Blair Bickerstaff, who at 27 is the youngest assistant coach in the NBA. Hollins scored five of his career-high seven points in the fourth quarter. "That's what I wanted to do, play hard," said Hollins, a second-round pick in last year's draft. "That's infectious. It rubs off on guys. I felt like I tried to give the team a lift. We made a run at it." Raymond Felton  had 18 points and five turnovers and  Emeka Okafor  added 14 points and 21 rebounds for the Bobcats, who shot 39 percent as they lost their second straight game after a three-game winning streak. "The second half, the kids were terrific," said Bickerstaff, who was ejected for the first time this season. "They had the energy level. They could have easily surrendered." Charlotte was without forward  Sean May , who was plagued by pain in his right knee he had surgically repaired last season. He joined forward  Gerald Wallace  (right shoulder), who missed his seventh straight game and guard  Brevin Knight  (torn abdominal muscle), who sat out his 12th straight. The Nets took control with a 16-3 run to close the first half. Kidd and  Richard Jefferson  hit back-to-back 3-pointers and  Mikki Moore  had an alley-oop dunk from Kidd during the spurt as New Jersey took a 53-34 halftime lead. Bernie Bickerstaff may have had the best idea by getting tossed midway through the run. Upset with a foul called against  Adam Morrison , Bickerstaff charged onto the court and picked up two technical fouls within seconds. Carter had a spectacular one-handed dunk and a 3-pointer on consecutive possessions after back-to-back turnovers by Felton that gave New Jersey a 66-43 lead. Kidd continued to show no ill-effects from going through a highly publicized divorce and rumblings that he might be on the trading block. He shot 6-of-13 and added seven rebounds and three assists as the Nets avenged a home loss to Charlotte in November. The Nets started 11-17, but their recent hot streak has moved them within two games of .500 and to the top of the weak Atlantic Division. "It's just find a way to win, by any means," Carter said. "We put ourselves in a hole, so we can't complain how the win looks. We just want to get back to .500 and into this playoff race."
