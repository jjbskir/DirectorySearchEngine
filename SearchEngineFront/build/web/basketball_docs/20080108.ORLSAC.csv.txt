SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Facing a fifth straight home loss, the
injury-plagued  Sacramento Kings  responded by beating the NBA's best
road team. 	    John Salmons  scored 21 points and  Brad Miller  had 20 to help the
Kings hold off the  Orlando Magic , 104-100 on Tuesday night. 	   The win snapped a rare four-game losing streak for the Kings at
friendly Arco Arena. And it came against the Magic, who at 15-6
have the most road wins this season in the NBA. 	   "We know how good Orlando is on the road, they are one of the
best in the league," Salmons said. "Our last homestand (0-4)
wasn't good, so we needed this win." 	   Despite the urgency, the Kings almost didn't get it. They
committed seven turnovers and were outscored 38-26 in the fourth
quarter, when they squandered much of their once 19-point lead. 	   "It kind of took the fun out of me, you have to have success at
the end of games," Kings coach Reggie Theus said. "I look at it
in many ways, good teams are always going to make a run. So they
made a run and we held them off." 	    Beno Udrih  had 17 points,  Quincy Douby  scored 14,  Francisco Garcia  had 11 and  Mikki Moore  added eight points and 12 rebounds
for the Kings, who had lost two straight and six of seven games. 	    Dwight Howard  had 29 points and 15 rebounds, but also committed
six turnovers for Orlando, which has lost three straight.  Rashard Lewis  made six 3-pointers and scored 22 points before fouling out
in the fourth quarter.  Hedo Turkoglu  added 14 points and  J.J. Redick  had 10, all in the fourth quarter. 	   Turkoglu made a 3-pointer to pull Orlando within 103-100 with 19
seconds remaining. Seconds later, Garcia hit one of two free throws
to put the Kings up by four points. Redick passed up a 3-pointer
and Orlando never got off another shot. 	   A 7-0 run early in the fourth quarter put the Kings seemingly in
charge at 88-69. But Orlando came right back with nine straight
points against the suddenly mistake-prone Kings, who lead the NBA
in turnovers. 	   "We were sluggish in the first half and didn't play hard enough
until the fourth quarter," said Howard, who had eight
fourth-quarter points. "They had it going and we didn't. When a
team has it going like them it is hard to get over." 	   The Kings were undermanned once again, missing their top three
scorers from last season in starters  Ron Artest  (elbow),  Kevin Martin  (groin) and  Mike Bibby  (thumb). 	   Yet stepping up again was Salmons, who has averaged nearly 20
points as a starter this season. Douby, a reserve guard who has
struggled much of the season, had a second straight solid game,
matching his season high, including 12 points in the first half
when the Kings led by 15 points. 	   "The first half, that's the joy of the game," said Miller, who
had six assists. "You get halves like that sometimes. And things
were going well defensively, we held them to 38 points." 	   It's a challenging road trip for the Southeast Division-leading
Magic, who play four times in five nights, concluding with a
Saturday game in Utah. 	   "We've been coming out sluggish in the first half, our main
three guys need to take more responsibility in that area," Orlando
coach Stan Van Gundy said. "We are in a funk right now and need to
figure it out." 	   Quiet during the first half when he was outplayed by Howard,
Miller scored 11 points in the third quarter, when the Kings built
their lead to 78-62. 	   Udrih had 16 points in the first half, when the Kings took
advantage of a sluggish Orlando defense for a 53-38 lead.
 Game notes   Dahntay Jones  connected on his first 3-pointer of the
season at the buzzer, giving the Kings a 26-18 first-quarter lead.
Turkoglu, who was drafted by the Kings in 2000 and played his first
three years in Sacramento, was cheered after missing a
third-quarter dunk in traffic. Gary Gerould, who has been the voice
of the Kings since they arrived in Sacramento in 1985, missed a
rare game due to an illness.
