MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With 3.3 seconds on the clock and the game
tied in overtime,  Kevin Garnett  had one thing on his mind -- slow
down. After missing the potential game-winner at the end of
regulation, Garnett hit a 15-footer with  Samuel Dalembert 's hand in
his face as the buzzer sounded in overtime to lift the Timberwolves
to a 104-102 victory over the  Philadelphia 76ers  on Friday night. "Right before overtime, I told myself when I had the shot that
I rushed it a little bit," Garnett said. "I had to take my
time." Garnett finished with 25 points and 14 rebounds, and Trenton
Hassell tied a career high with 22 points for the Wolves, who won
their third game in a row and sixth of their last eight. With the game tied at 96 in regulation, Garnett missed a
fallaway baseline jumper at the buzzer that would have given the
Wolves the win. But he came right back in overtime, dropping a baby
hook and a 22-foot jumper to give the Wolves a 102-100 lead with
1:02 to go. After Philly tied the game on an alley-oop from  Andre Iguodala 
to Dalembert,  Randy Foye  tracked down a missed shot by Iguodala to
set up Garnett's heroics. "It came out and left too much time on the clock," Iguodala
said of his miss. "That was on me, I think I should have just let
the clock run out and they wouldn't have had an opportunity to
score." When the game-winner fell, it was some vindication for Garnett,
who has been criticized during his 12 years for disappearing late
in game. "I hear so much (grief) about not taking games over," he
griped. Foye had 11 points and 10 assists for the Wolves. Even without the traded  Allen Iverson  and injured  Chris Webber ,
the Sixers were no pushover in this one. Kyle Korver  had 25 points and Iguodala had 23 points, nine
assists and seven rebounds for Philadelphia in the final game of a
grueling seven-game road trip. The only team in the last 50 years to play 22 of its first 33
games of the season away from home, Philadelphia showed plenty of
fight. "We got down nine points in the fourth quarter with like 3 or 4
minutes left, and we fought our way back, giving ourselves a chance
to win the game," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. "So, the
effort that we put on the floor was tremendous. We just have to
learn to finish those games." The Timberwolves led 90-82 after Hassell hit a high-arcing
jumper from the baseline to cap a 10-0 run with just over 6 minutes
to go. Philly came right back, with Iguodala dunking and then getting a
transition layup to tie the game at 94 with 1:30 to play. The Sixers led 100-98 in overtime after a pair of free throws by
 Andre Miller , but just missed out on improving to 5-5 since trading
Iverson to Denver last month. They were 5-18 with Iverson. "I think we have to make it a collective group effort,"
Iguodala said. "Kyle stepped up big tonight. Sam played pretty
good defense on Kevin tonight. They just had some other guys step
up, like  Trenton Hassell . He was huge for them tonight. Randy Foye
played great. They just played a better game." It was a matchup of two teams that were closely linked in
mid-December during the Iverson sweepstakes. The Timberwolves made a heavy push for AI, but in the end did
not have the expiring contracts or the first-round draft picks the
Sixers coveted. So Philly made the deal with the Nuggets, acquiring
 Joe Smith , two first-round picks and Miller -- who had 18 points, 11
assists and seven rebounds -- for Iverson and  Ivan McFarlin . The Sixers really wanted Foye in any deal involving Minnesota,
but Wolves basketball boss Kevin McHale was reluctant to include
the promising rookie in any offering. The NBA rookie of the month for December showed plenty of grit
in the fourth quarter, scoring on a drive and a then a pretty
one-handed scoop to give Minnesota an 80-79 lead with 9:27 to go. "My first double-double," Foye said. "That felt good." Game notes Webber missed his fifth straight game with a bruised right
foot. Cheeks said the team is being cautious to make sure he
doesn't return too soon. ... Wolves F  Marko Jaric  played with a
splint on his right thumb. He had an MRI that revealed no ligament
damage, only a sprain, coach Dwane Casey said. ... Minnesota Twins
closer Joe Nathan was in attendance.
