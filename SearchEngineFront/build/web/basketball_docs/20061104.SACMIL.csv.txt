MILWAUKEE (AP) --  Michael Redd  is happy to share the scoring load
with the rest of the  Milwaukee Bucks . Redd scored 26 points,  Charlie Villanueva  had 25 and the Bucks
beat the  Sacramento Kings  104-91 in their home opener Saturday
night. Andrew Bogut  finished with 21 points and eight rebounds for the
Bucks, who had lost four in a row and nine of their last 10 against
Sacramento since January 2002. Mo Williams  had 15 points and 12 assists and  Ruben Patterson 
added 10 points as all five starters scored in double figures for
Milwaukee. "That's the beauty of the team this year," Redd said. "Our
offense is really explosive, really diverse. We have multiple guys
that can score. It showed tonight." The Kings were led by reserves  John Salmons  and Shareef
Abdur-Rahim. Salmons scored 18 points and Abdur-Rahim added 15.
 Kevin Martin  also had 15 points and  Mike Bibby  finished with 12. Villanueva gave the Bucks a surprise lift. He left the game
against the  Toronto Raptors  on Friday night with a sore right calf
and was doubtful for the home opener. Villanueva, who came to Milwaukee from Toronto in an offseason
trade for point guard  T.J. Ford , just missed his third
double-double when he finished with seven rebounds. The former
Connecticut star and No. 7 pick of the Raptors in the 2005 draft
had 17 points and 11 rebounds in a 109-92 loss against the Raptors
on Friday. "We have so many options," Bogut said. "Look at our starting
five. I think (general manager) Larry (Harris) has done a great of
putting this team together." Villanueva was 11-of-17 from the floor, including 3-for-4 from
3-point range. Despite missing the entire preseason with a leg injury, Bogut
has had three strong games to start the season. The top pick in the
2005 draft is averaging 18.3 points and eight rebounds. After
playing forward last season, he moved to center and has responded
very well, making 22 of 32 shots so far. "Andrew is our man," Williams said. "We all know Mike is our
All-Star, but the centerpiece of this team is Andrew. We want to go
to him because he can do so many things with the ball. We have to
play through him at times." Bogut was 7-of-10 from the floor and made all of his seven free
throws. He finished three points shy of his career high. "He and I play well together," Villanueva said. "And, I have
got to give a lot of credit to Andrew. The kid can play. The kid
can flat-out play." Ron Artest , who had 22 points and 13 rebounds in the Kings'
89-88 victory over the  Chicago Bulls  on Friday night, was in early
foul trouble and finished with seven points. The Bucks turned it around in the third quarter when they
tightened their defense and started hitting shots. Shooting
14-of-21, they erased the Kings' 55-49 halftime lead and outscored
Sacramento 37-16 in the period. "They came out and kind of opened it up pretty bad," Bibby
said. "We weren't hitting any shots and they were. They were being
aggressive, we weren't. We were playing timid and that's were it
all came down to." The Kings were 7-of-22 in the third quarter. Bogut, who had six points in the first half, had 15 in the third
on 5-of-6 shooting. "It's being more assertive and more confident when I have the
ball," he said. Milwaukee seemed to capitalize on the absence of Kings center
 Brad Miller , who left the game in the second quarter with plantar
fasciitis in his left foot and did not return. Miller, who left the locker room with his foot in a protective
boot, said the injury would be evaluated on Monday. "We'll see where it's at," he said. Sacramento never challenged in the fourth as Milwaukee pushed
the lead to 21 points, 98-77, on a dunk by Villanueva with 7:54
left to play. The Bucks cleared the bench down the stretch, but the
lead never got below 13. Referee Violet Palmer called a technical on Williams in the
second quarter for trying to trip Martin after fouling him during a
drive to the Kings' basket. Martin made the technical and the two
free throws to start an 8-0 run capped by Bibby's driving layup
that gave Sacramento a 52-42 lead with 1:22 left in the first
half. Game notes The Kings' bench outscored the Bucks' reserves 23-1 in the
