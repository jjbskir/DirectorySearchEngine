Bosh had 27 points and 15 rebounds,  Hedo Turkoglu  set season highs with 26 points and 11 rebounds and the  Toronto Raptors  rallied for a 106-104 victory over the  New York Knicks .

David Lee didn't let Thursday's All-Star Game snub affect his play against the Raptors, writes Chris Sheridan.  Story 
 
 
 It was a nice end to a fun day for Bosh, a Dallas native who was selected Thursday for his fifth All-Star game -- tying  Vince Carter 's Raptors record. The NBA revealed the reserves for the Feb. 14 game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington a few hours before Toronto earned its fourth consecutive victory. "I think everything's clicking," Bosh said. "We're looking for our shots, we're being aggressive. At the same time, we know how the game's supposed to flow, who's open, the offensive sets we want to run. I mean it's coming together bit by bit." Jarrett Jack  made one of two free throws in the final seconds and drew a charging call on  Al Harrington  on New York's final possession, helping Toronto (25-22) move three games over .500 for the first time this season. The Raptors, who erased a 13-point deficit Wednesday night in a 111-103 victory over Miami, have trailed by double digits in each game during their winning streak. David Lee  had 29 points and 18 rebounds for New York, 3-7 in its last 10 games. The sluggish stretch includes a victory over woeful Minnesota and an embarrassing 128-78 loss to Dallas on Sunday -- the worst home loss in franchise history. It could get worse, too. Knicks forward  Jared Jeffries  left with a hyperextended right knee and is scheduled for an MRI on Friday. Harrington also said he's going to the doctor to get treatment for his balky left knee. "It's been bothering me for six weeks," Harrington said. "It's been a while, a long time, but I was trying to hide it, and just keep playing through it. ... This one is sticking with me." Antoine Wright  scored 13 points, and fellow reserve  Jose Calderon  had 12 for Toronto, which got off to a slow start before rallying behind Turkoglu's best game since he was acquired from Orlando in the offseason. "I just look at the way I bring effort and energy," said Turkoglu, who scored 18 points in the second half. "I had 11 rebounds too so I have to just look at both ends of the court, what I did and help the team, not just statistically. I've never been a statistic guy." Bosh hit two free throws with 7 minutes left to give the Raptors a 91-85 lead, but New York battled back. Harrington converted a three-point play and made a 3-pointer to put the Knicks in front 100-97 at the 2:51 mark. Lee then got free for a dunk to extend the lead to five. Back came the Raptors, who scored the next eight points. Turkoglu had two free throws and a rebound basket, and Jack scored inside. Bosh then drove past  Wilson Chandler  to make it 105-102 with 15.9 seconds remaining. After Lee's rebound basket, Jack hit a free throw, then got in front of Harrington on defense to secure the victory. Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said the ball was supposed to be inbounded to  Nate Robinson . "I was just the last resort and when I got it my leg killed me and I had no brakes," Harrington said. "I just tried to make the play and obviously got called for the charge." Harrington finished with 20 points, and Chandler had 14 for New York. Lee shrugged off his All-Star miss before the game, saying it was out of control and calling the snub "motivation" for the rest of the season. He sure looked motivated against Toronto. Lee ripped the Raptors for 17 points and 10 rebounds in the first half, showing off a nice face-up jumper and plenty of poise inside. He powered the Knicks to a 34-20 lead after one quarter, but Calderon had eight points in the second quarter to help Toronto cut it to 53-49 at halftime. "They started making shots when they were pretty cold at first, and they did come back," D'Antoni said, "but we're up five points with about 50 seconds to go, that's kind of where it turned on us." Game notes  Raptors rookie G  DeMar DeRozan  missed his second consecutive game because of a sprained right ankle. He was replaced in the starting lineup by  Sonny Weems . DeRozan didn't make the trip to New York. ... Raptors coach Jay Triano said before the game that C  Andrea Bargnani  hurt his foot in the closing seconds of Toronto's victory over Miami on Wednesday night. But Triano didn't specify which foot, and Bargnani started against New York.
