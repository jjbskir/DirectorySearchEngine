SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Wizards coach Eddie Jordan acknowledged that
he lost his cool Saturday night. To say the least. Jordan was ejected in the third quarter of Washington's 93-80
loss to the  San Antonio Spurs  after going onto the court to yell at
the officials. "I lost my composure, and I probably shouldn't have," Jordan
said. "And that's the way it is. You just go back there, watch the
game by yourself and root for the team." With or without Jordan, the Wizards weren't showing much of the
form that led them to victories in 11 of their previous 15 games. They shot just 27-of-87 (31 percent) from the field and had only
eight assists while tying their season low in points. Gilbert Arenas  led the Wizards with 17 points, well below his
average of 30 per game, as he went 6-of-20 from the field. "I thought we did a pretty good job to control him. He's having
an unbelievable season," said  Tony Parker , who had 13 points and
10 rebounds. Tim Duncan  had 18 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio, while
 Fabricio Oberto  had five points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the
Spurs' impressive defensive effort. "I think for the last two or three weeks we've become the
defensive team, or we're on the road to becoming the defensive team
we've been the last six or eight years," Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich said. Antonio Daniels  had 12 points for Washington,  Antawn Jamison 
added 11 and  Caron Butler  and  Andray Blatche  had 10 apiece. Butler
also had 12 boards. "Offensively we couldn't get any flow. We got to the paint,
missed layups, missed jump shots," Butler said. "The shots we
usually make. So we just got to tip our hat to them and get ready
for the next challenge." Meanwhile,  Manu Ginobili  led the Spurs with 19 points and found
himself in the middle of Jordan's outburst. With 5:25 left in the third, Ginobili stripped Arenas of the
ball. Parker got hold of it, then passed it back to Ginobili, who
took it down court for a fast-break dunk. Washington's coaches came out onto the court yelling at the
officials, apparently because no foul was called. Jordan charged
way out onto the floor, pushing through a couple of his own players
who were trying to hold him back. He was quickly given two technicals and ejected from the game. "I got fouled three times on that play," Arenas said. "Bruce
(Bowen) got me on the arm, and then (Robert) Horry and Ginobili. "If it had happened to Tim Duncan, Pop would have gotten mad,
too." The Spurs took a 29-15 lead into the second quarter. The Wizards
tied their season-low total for a first quarter. "We came out and it was just bad possession after possession,
we couldn't find that rim," Arenas said. "Our target was off." San Antonio extended the lead to 17 points, but an 8-0 run by
the Wizards cut it to 44-38 at halftime. With about 8  minutes left in the third, San Antonio's Matt
Bonner had to be carried off the court after injuring his left
knee. The Spurs said he tore his left MCL and will undergo an MRI
Sunday. He is expected to miss two to six weeks. Bonner had two
points Saturday. The Spurs ended the third quarter up 69-54. With 10:05 left in the fourth, officials called a technical on
the Spurs'  Robert Horry  just after he'd been called for a foul. < The Spurs improved to 27-11; the Wizards fell to 20-16. Game notes The Spurs have won seven straight at home against the
Wizards. ... The Spurs will visit the  Chicago Bulls  on Monday. The
Wizards will take on the  Utah Jazz  in Washington. ... Saturday's
game was "Spurs Military Appreciation Night." At halftime, former
Spur  David Robinson , who spent two years in the Navy, presented
Purple Hearts to several wounded service members.
