MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The first few times  Dwight Howard  played
against  Kevin Garnett , he was a wide-eyed kid awed by being on the
same floor as his idol. He's all grown up now.

 Howard Dwight Howard had 21 points and 22 rebounds in Orlando's 109-98 win in Minnesota. It was the third 20/20 game of Howard's career. Only two players in NBA history had more 20/20 games prior to their 21st birthday: John Drew and Shaquille O'Neal (both had six such games before turning 21 years old).

Howard went toe-to-toe with Garnett, scoring 21 points and
grabbing 22 rebounds to lead the  Orlando Magic  to a 109-98 victory
over the slumping  Minnesota Timberwolves  on Saturday night. "When I first played against him, I was like, 'Whoa, that's
KG.' I was just happy to play against him," said Howard, who
already has grabbed at least 20 rebounds in a game six times in his
career. "After my first two years, I was like, 'I know I have to play
KG. I know all the things he's going to do.' I just really tried to
get after him and go back at him every time they scored." Jameer Nelson  added 23 points and  Darko Milicic  had a
season-high 15 points and five rebounds for Orlando, which led by
as many as 20 points and cruised after a strong first quarter. Garnett had 28 points and 11 rebounds, but Minnesota couldn't
keep up with the young, athletic Magic on the defensive end and
lost its fourth in a row after a 2-0 start. "I don't think confidence is a problem," Garnett said. "Being
consistent for 48 minutes is the big question. Consistency is the
big word here." The last time the present and future of NBA power forwards met
in March, Howard admitted to being nervous against the player who
blazed the trail for high schoolers like him to make the jump
straight to the pros. Garnett dominated that matchup with 27 points, 19 rebounds and
six assists to Howard's 15 points and 12 boards, showing that the
young man had plenty to learn before he was ready to take the
torch. This time, Howard didn't let the former MVP push him around.
Instead he was the aggressor, going right at one of the league's
best defensive players on the low block. "When I play against KG, it's like, 'OK, this is the guy I
watched growing up, wanted to be like," Howard said. "So I'm
always excited to be on the court when I get to play KG." Playing without leading scorer  Grant Hill , who was deactivated
to rest on the second night of a back-to-back, the Magic led by
nine after the first quarter behind a monster start by Howard. The third-year pro scored 12 points on 6-of-6 shooting, most of
them against Garnett, and grabbed nine rebounds to help the Magic
to a 29-20 lead. Howard did a little bit of everything in the first, throwing
down two thunderous dunks and backing Garnett down in the paint,
then finishing with a soft baby hook. "I thought Dwight showed he was a special player tonight,"
Magic coach Brian Hill said. The Magic shot 74 percent in the first quarter, while
Minnesota's shooting woes continued. The Timberwolves came into the game averaging just over 85
points in their last three losses, and they missed 20 of their
first 26 shots. Milicic took over in the second period, scoring 10 points and
creating a mismatch with his size down low and the Magic
outrebounded Minnesota 46-28. "It's still early, but we have to jump-start it," Timberwolves
coach Dwane Casey said. "We're carrying our misses on the
offensive end over to the defensive end." Time and again, Garnett tried to push Howard off the block,
making him set up shop on the baseline. But Howard showed a
dazzling array of low-post moves and nimble footwork that allowed
him to get any shot he wanted. In one sequence in the first quarter, Howard outleaped 6-foot-10
forward  Eddie Griffin  to snatch a ferocious rebound, came down in
the paint, made a lightning-quick spin move and threw down a hammer
dunk that rocked the goal. The display of raw power clearly stunned the Timberwolves, and
the rest of the league may be next. "No, I haven't arrived," Howard said. "I still have a long
way to go in my career. I'm only 20 years old. Each practice, each
game, I'm looking to do something different." Game notes A gift was left in Timberwolves coach Dwane Casey's office
