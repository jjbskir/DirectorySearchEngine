 Wallace Ben Wallace had 20 rebounds, 15 points and five blocked shots in the Bulls' 99-84 triumph over the Sonics. It was the first NBA game in more than a year in which a player met each of those thresholds. The last to do so was Denver's Marcus Camby, who had 22 rebounds, 18 points and seven blocks in a win over Minnesota on Nov. 13 of last year.  For more Elias Says,  click here 
 
 
 The former Detroit star had a season-high 15 points and 20
rebounds to lead the Bulls to a 99-84 victory over the Seattle
SuperSonics on Wednesday night. Ben Gordon  added 27 points and  Andres Nocioni  had 20 in
Chicago's ninth victory in its last 10 games. Wallace also had five
blocked shots, tying his season high. "Anytime you leave a situation like I was in, coming to
something new, I was in Detroit for six years and to take on a new
challenge at this point in my career there is always going to be a
little bit of an adjustment," said Wallace, who was benched
earlier during a game for disobeying team rules and wearing a
headband. "For the most part I think the transition has gone
pretty smooth." Bulls coach Scott Skiles wants Wallace to be part of the
offense. "We throw Ben the ball quite a bit in the course of games,"
Skiles said. "Tonight, he saw some openings and took them and
scored. It is silly to say he had a big game, he had 20 rebounds,
but that was a big time performance." The Sonics played without  Ray Allen  and  Earl Watson . Allen, who
was not with the team, missed his fifth straight game because of a
bone bruise in his right foot, while Earl Watson suited up but
didn't play because of a lower back contusion. Chicago jumped out to a 28-12 lead, with Nocioni scoring seven
points and  Luol Deng  adding eight. Wallace had five points, seven
rebounds and three blocks in the quarter. The Bulls beat the Sonics at home for the first time since
1997-98, when they won their sixth championship in  Michael Jordan 's
final season with the team. Prior to Wednesday night, Chicago had
dropped eight straight to the Sonics at the United Center. Rashard Lewis  scored 18 points for the Sonics, and Damien
Wilkins added 16. "Our bigs were foul trouble. Our bigs didn't really play that
much tonight," Lewis said. "With Ben Wallace out there, it's hard
to keep him off the glass." Deng finished with 13 points, and  Kirk Hinrich  had 14 points and
eight assists.
