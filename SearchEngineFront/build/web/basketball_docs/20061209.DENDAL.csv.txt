DALLAS (AP) --  Josh Howard  was just as proud of his matching his
career-high scoring total as he was of his defense against NBA
leading-scorer  Carmelo Anthony . Howard scored 30 points,  Dirk Nowitzki  added 25 and  Jason Terry 
had 14 of his 24 in the first quarter to help the Mavericks build
early leads of as many as 18 points in Dallas' 105-90 victory over
the weary  Denver Nuggets  on Saturday night. Anthony started the night with a scoring average of 31.7 points
per game, but finished with 18 on 8-for-26 shooting. "It was a great team effort," said Howard, who took turns with
teammates  Devean George  and  Greg Buckner  guarding the explosive
Anthony, who had fewer than 20 points for only the second time this
season. "We kept giving him different looks, coming at him from
different angles." J.R. Smith  also scored 18 points for the Nuggets, who had won
eight of their last 10 games. The Nuggets were on the second leg of a tough back-to-back in
less than 24 hours against the teams that played in the NBA finals
last season, and they set a season low for points. Denver beat defending NBA champion Miami 123-107 at home Friday
night, then traveled to Texas after the game to take on the
runner-up Mavericks. "Anytime you play two teams like Miami and Dallas back-to-back,
it's going to be trouble," Anthony said. "We knew it was going to
be a test." Anthony credited the Mavericks' defense for his cold-shooting
night. "The shots I normally make I didn't make," Anthony said. At times, the Mavericks double- and triple-teamed Anthony when
he had the ball. "That led to frustration and like they do with all great
players, they brought over a second and a third man," Denver coach
George Karl said. Dallas, which was off on Friday night, had fresher legs as the
Mavericks scored 41 points in the opening quarter for their highest
first-quarter output this season. "We came out with pretty good energy," Mavericks coach Avery
Johnson said. "We wanted to be pretty aggressive." The Mavericks converted 13 of their first 15 field goal attempts
and used a 16-2 run to blow the game open, building a 41-25 lead
entering the second quarter. Dallas, loser of two of its previous
three games after a 12-game winning streak, carried a 62-41
halftime lead behind Howard's 20 points. "We didn't pass the ball, we forced way too many shots," Karl
said. "Instead of staying away from the crowd, we threw the ball
into the crowd." After three quarters, the Mavericks were still comfortably in
front, 83-70, and the Nuggets never got closer than 10 the rest of
the way. Defense was the key, Johnson said. "[Denver] is a team capable of scoring 150 points and they come
in here and score 90," Johnson said. "(Anthony) has been having
an All-Star season. I don't think he'll go 8-for-26 from the field
again." The Mavericks were without  Jerry Stackhouse  (groin) and Austin
Croshere (hamstring). Missing for the Nuggets were  Joe Smith 
(ankle) and  Reggie Evans  (strep throat). Game notes The Nuggets didn't get into their Dallas hotel rooms until
4 a.m. on Saturday after playing a late game in Denver on Friday
night. ... Karl admitted that his team considered a trade for
Philadelphia G  Allen Iverson  over the summer, but Karl said trading
for Iverson now would be unlikely. "I'm not going to deny we were
interested, but we're happy with our team now," Karl said. "He's
a great player. I'm sad but that's the world of sports today where
a team has to trade the player who built them because they have to
get rid of the biggest contract. I hope he ends up with a team that
jump-starts his career." ... The Nuggets have lost 17 of their
last 18 games in Dallas. ... New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton
was the guest of Mavericks coach  Avery Johnson . The Saints face the
Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night and Johnson, a New Orleans native,
is a Saints fan.
