PHILADELPHIA (AP) --  Kelenna Azubuike  wiped out his poor shooting
performance with one basket -- the game-winner. 	   Azubuike made a 3-pointer from the left corner with 6.1 seconds
left in overtime, giving the  Golden State Warriors  a 100-98 victory
over the  Philadelphia 76ers  on Saturday night. 	   Azubuike was just 2-for-9 from the floor before making the 3 but
point guard  Baron Davis  did not hesitate to pass the ball to him on
the perimeter. 	   "We wanted to space the court and Baron was to create," Golden
State coach Don Nelson said. "It was up to Baron to find a
shooter." 	   The 76ers had one last chance after Azubuike's basket, but Louis
Williams lost his footing in the lane and turned the ball over. 	   Azubuike's basket came after  Andre Iguodala  gave Philadelphia a
98-97 lead on a runner in heavy traffic with 13.4 seconds left. 	   Azubuike finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds,  Monta Ellis 
equaled his career high with 31, while Baron Davis came on strong
in overtime and scored 22 for Golden State, which has won five of
six games since an 0-6 start.  Andris Biedrins  grabbed 14 rebounds 
for the Warriors. 	   "We definitely needed to come out tonight playing hard and
leave with a win," said Golden State's  Stephen Jackson , who shot
just 6-for-18 from the floor and committed eight turnovers, but
also scored 18 points. "Fortunately we found a way, and that's
what you have to do in this league, especially on the road." 	   Golden State wrapped up its five-game road trip with a 4-1
record, the first time the Warriors finished with a winning mark on
a trip of five or more games since December 1980. 	   Iguodala led the 76ers with 26 points,  Andre Miller  added 23,
and Williams scored 18 off the bench, but the 76ers lost their
third straight and seventh in the last eight. 	   It was the second tough loss in two nights for the 76ers, who
fell down the stretch Friday at Detroit. 	   "We just have to get a win, we have to do more than just
compete," Iguodala said. 	   Neither team scored in the final 2:12 of regulation after
Iguodala hit a pair of free throws to tie the game at 90. 	   Philadelphia's  Samuel Dalembert  missed a shot from the foul line
with 33.6 seconds left,  Stephen Jackson  missed from the corner at
the other end and Iguodala failed on a 17-foot jumper with a hand
in his face and the clock winding down in regulation. 	   The 76ers took advantage of Golden State's sluggish start to
build a double-digit lead midway through the first quarter. The
Warriors missed 11 of their first 13 shots from the floor, while
Dalembert's bucket capped an 8-0 run and put Philadelphia up 19-6. 	   Golden State shot just 14-for-43 in the first half (32.6
percent) but stayed close at 57-45 thanks to Ellis, who scored 16
points before the break. 	   "Ellis put us on his shoulders," Nelson said. "He was the
only guy with any energy." 	   The Warriors opened the third quarter with a 15-2 run, capped by
Baron Davis' three-point play that gave Golden State a 60-59 lead,
their first of the night. 	   Iguodala restored the 76ers' lead with a three-point play on
Philadelphia's next possession. The teams seesawed back-and-forth
the remainder of the quarter as the 76ers went ahead 72-66 on
Miller's free throw, but Golden State scored the next seven points
and forged back ahead, 73-72, on a foul shot by  Mickael Pietrus .
 Thaddeus Young 's spin move put the 76ers back on top 76-75 heading
into the final quarter. 	   "We laid an egg in the first half," Nelson said. "We didn't
have much in the tank down the stretch, but we made some big
shots." Game notes  Ellis scored the most points by a 76ers opponent this
season The Warriors last 4-1 road trip came in Nov. 1973 Golden
State's Jackson is averaging 20.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.2
assists in five contests since his return from a seven-game NBA
suspension The Warriors have won four straight and six of seven
against the 76ers.
