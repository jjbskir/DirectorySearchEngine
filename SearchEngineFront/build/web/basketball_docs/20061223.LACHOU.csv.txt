HOUSTON (AP) -- Suddenly, the  Houston Rockets  are facing a second straight season ruined by injuries to All-Stars  Yao Ming  and  Tracy McGrady . Yao is out at least six weeks after fracturing the bone under his right knee in the  Los Angeles Clippers ' 98-93 victory over the Rockets on Saturday night. Elias Says The Rockets, who are already playing without Tracy McGrady, lost Yao Ming with a knee injury during Saturday night's game against the Clippers.  Since 2004-05, McGrady's first season in Houston, the Rockets are 83-44 (.654) in games in which both TMac and Yao play, 1-8 (.111) when neither play, 7-11 (.389) with McGrady, but not Yao, and 10-27 (.270) with Yao, but not McGrady.

The Rockets initially said Yao suffered a bone bruise, but an MRI test revealed a fracture of his right tibial plateau, trainer Keith Jones said. The injury wrecks the best start of Yao's career. He was averaging 27 points and nine rebounds and had topped 30 points in four consecutive games before scoring 22 in Friday's 97-78 win at San Antonio. "That's our guy," guard  Rafer Alston  said. "You're talking about a guy who's on an MVP pace, a guy that's been carrying this team for the last two seasons. That hurts." The Rockets were already playing without Tracy McGrady, who sat out his seventh consecutive game with back spasms. The injuries are ominous flashbacks to last season, when Yao and McGrady missed a total of 60 games with injuries and Houston finished 34-48. The Rockets went 1-8 last season when neither Yao nor McGrady played. "We don't have a choice," said  Shane Battier , who scored a season-high 28 on Saturday. "We have to be tougher, we have to be more mentally sharp and we have to not expect less from ourselves when T-Mac and Yao are out." Houston coach Jeff Van Gundy said before Saturday's game that he was uncertain when McGrady would return. Yao is gone until at least mid-February and faces his third injury rehab in a year. Last December, he underwent surgery for a toe infection and missed 21 games. In April, he broke his left foot in Utah and missed the final four games of the season. "If there's ever been an athlete who doesn't deserve the bad breaks he's gotten the last two years, it's him," said Van Gundy. "He works hard, he's in great shape, so I feel badly for him." Tim Thomas  scored 21 points and  Chris Kaman  had 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who snapped a six-game losing streak.  Cuttino Mobley  scored 18 and  Elton Brand  had 16 points, seven rebounds and four assists as Los Angeles finally took control in the fourth quarter after Yao got hurt. "We got a major break when Yao went down," said Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy . "We moved the ball better, we had open gaps and we were able to make our shots." The Rockets led 14-12 when Yao went down clutching his right knee and screaming in pain. Yao was leaping for a blocked shot as  Chuck Hayes  and Thomas hit the floor beneath him. Yao's knee appeared to get caught under Thomas' body. After a tense few minutes, Jones and  Bonzi Wells  helped Yao limp to the locker room. "It was a shock when I saw him down on the floor like that," said Houston guard  Luther Head . "Yao falls a lot, but this time, he didn't get up for a long time. You saw a lot of people's heads go down." Houston survived for more than two quarters without Yao, turning to its perimeter shooting and league-leading scoring defense to keep the lead. The Rockets led 48-39 at the break after going 6-for-9 from 3-point range and holding the Clippers to 35 percent shooting. Battier made three 3-pointers in the first half and had 20 points at halftime, two more than his previous season high.  Dikembe Mutombo , Yao's backup, had two points, eight rebounds and four blocks in the opening half. Battier started the second half with a left-handed hook to match the Rockets' biggest lead. But the 7-foot Kaman scored twice over Mutombo to start a 14-3 Clippers spurt -- and the Rockets' collapse. "We have enough to win and we didn't play that way," Van Gundy said. "I feel badly for Yao, but I was very disappointed in the group effort in the second half." Head hit a 3-pointer to put the Rockets up 53-45, but Thomas and Mobley sank back-to-back 3-pointers and Mobley made a turnaround jumper to tie the game. The Rockets were lucky to trail only 69-67 heading to the fourth quarter. They went 7-for-21 from the field and were outrebounded 11-6 in the third. Close-range baskets by  Shaun Livingston  and  Corey Maggette  snapped a 71-all tie and the Clippers inched away as the Rockets looked increasingly inept on both ends without Yao to bail them out. Mobley beat Head to a loose ball and ran for a breakaway dunk with 4:40 left to put the Clippers up 87-79. Livingston followed with a deep jumper and Brand drove for a dunk that gave the Clippers a 91-79 lead. Alston scored on two drives in the final 1:11 to draw the Rockets within four, but  Daniel Ewing  sank three free throws in the last 25 seconds to secure the victory. Game notes  Former Rocket  Sam Cassell  played eight minutes and did not score, then sat out the second half with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. ... Thomas' 21 points tied his season high.
