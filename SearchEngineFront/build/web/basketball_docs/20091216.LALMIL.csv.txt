MILWAUKEE --  Kobe Bryant  reverted to an old habit when he missed a potential game-winning shot. Given a second opportunity, he stuck with the change he's made since breaking his right index finger. Bryant hit a 15-footer as time expired and scored the game's final seven points over the last 1:18 of overtime to lift the  Los Angeles Lakers  to a 107-106 victory over the  Milwaukee Bucks  on Wednesday night. Bryant, who had 27 of his 39 points in the second half and overtime, missed a shot from nearly the same spot from the left elbow that would've won it at the buzzer to end regulation.

 "I changed my grip since the finger, so that first shot I took had my original grip and the ball kind of came off the wrong way," said Bryant, who broke the finger against Minnesota on Friday. "I was upset because if I was going to miss it, I'd rather miss it with things I've practiced in the last few days. I was happy to get another look." On his second try, he backed down  Charlie Bell  again and drained the jumper to start the celebration by raising his arms triumphantly and returning to the Lakers bench where he was mobbed. "I had a really good look on that first one and wanted to go right back to the same spot and get the same look," Bryant said. Pau Gasol  had 26 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the Lakers (20-4), who tied Boston for the best record in the NBA with their 13th win in the last 14 games. Bryant, who scored 42 points in a win over Chicago on Tuesday night, was again sharp when it counted despite the finger that's been hampering his ballhandling and follow through. He went 13 of 28 from the field and hit all 12 of his free-throw attempts, but committed seven turnovers after committing eight against the Bulls. He said he took a whack on the hand and it remains sore, but this one was much more painful for the Bucks. Reserve  Michael Redd  had 25 points and  Ersan Ilyasova  added a career-high 24, but the Bucks lost their fourth straight in the series with the Lakers and are 3-14 in the last 17 meetings. "I hate losing to him," said Redd, back for his second game after missing seven with left knee soreness. Milwaukee took a 106-100 lead in overtime after Redd hit a 3 and  Luke Ridnour  added a 15-footer. Bryant hit a jumper and after Ilyasova missed two free throws, the Lakers star added a three-point play by plowing into  Andrew Bogut , who had 16 points and 12 rebounds, to make it 106-105 with 48 seconds left. Bogut and Bell both declined to criticize the officiating, saying that they didn't want to draw a fine. But both were clearly perturbed and believed Bogut had position. "That was a huge play, the charge or block call," Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  said. "That's a huge play and if we get that stop right there, we're probably in good position." Milwaukee still had chances to win or at least stave off Bryant. Both Ridnour and Redd missed shots in the closing seconds for the Bucks, and  Ron Artest  grabbed a rebound with 5.4 seconds left. After a timeout,  Lamar Odom  inbounded the ball to Bryant, who hit the game-winner. "I did the best I could to make it a tough shot. He missed the first one, I thought it was good defense on the second one," Bell said. "Players like that, they try to get to a certain spot on the court. It's a comfort zone. He got to it." Gasol has 78 rebounds in his last four games, including three 20-rebound performances. Gasol's total is the NBA's best mark in a four-game span since  Marcus Camby  had 79 during a stretch that ended in January last season, according to STATS, LLC. "I'm just trying to be more active and more assertive. I'm trying to pursue the ball more instead of waiting for it," Gasol said. "The balls are bouncing my way a couple times more, but I'm just being active and hopefully I can keep it up." Milwaukee trailed 74-71 heading into the fourth, but took an 85-80 lead midway through the quarter. The Lakers failed to tie it until Gasol's three-point play and Bryant's turnaround fallaway evened it at 93 with 2:11 left. Derek Fisher  hit a 17-footer to give the Lakers the lead, but Bogut then drew a foul on Gasol and made the basket with 21 seconds left. Bogut missed the ensuing free throw and Bryant's 16-footer was contested by Bell to send the game to overtime. Jackson called the win "miraculous," but still took time to tease his superstar. "I told him, 'Why did you keep us waiting? You had the same situation in regulation. Really, you are wasting a half-hour of our lives,'" Jackson joked. "I just don't understand that boy sometimes." Game notes  Artest and Odom got technical fouls in the game, both for arguing calls. ... The Lakers didn't spend much time in Milwaukee. They took a bus to the Bradley Center after spending Tuesday night in Chicago and flew out after the game to New York. Los Angeles plays the Nets on Saturday. ... Artest said after shootaround that Tiger Woods "still is" a role model for him and his children. Artest wrote a post on his blog that was an open letter to the superstar golfer to encourage him.
