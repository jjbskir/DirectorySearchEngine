 The 6-foot-6 guard, averaging 36.4 points in his last five games, was serenaded with chants of "M-V-P! M-V-P!" from the Rose Garden crowd. "My No. 1 goal is to win. Not to be the MVP. Not to be the All-Star," said Roy, who kept the game ball as a souvenir. Blazers guard  Steve Blake  matched his season high with 22 points and added 10 assists, and  LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 10 of his 16 points in the first quarter to help Portland improve to 17-10. With the victory, Portland ended an 11-game losing streak to Phoenix dating to March 12, 2006. Amare Stoudemire  led the Suns with 23 points,  Matt Barnes  added 22,  Shaquille O'Neal  had 19, and  Steve Nash  finished with 15 points and 11 assists. Phoenix shot 56.9 percent from the field, and the Suns were even better from 3-point range, hitting 12 of 18. The Blazers weren't far behind, shooting 51.7 percent from the field, and hitting 11 3-pointers. Barnes and  Leandro Barbosa  combined to score the Suns' first 18 points of the second quarter to put Phoenix in front 48-38. A few minutes later, Portland nearly pulled even as Blake hit four consecutive jumpers, including two 3-pointers. But O'Neal, who scored 17 points in the first half, finished the quarter with a three-point play to give Phoenix a 66-59 halftime lead. Portland used a 39-point third quarter to take a 98-93 lead. Roy scored 14 consecutive points for Portland, triggering a spurt where the Blazers outscored Phoenix 26-9 during the final 6 minutes of the quarter. The Blazers scored the final seven points. Aldridge hit a difficult bank shot with 1:26 left to tie it at 119, then Roy put Portland ahead for good with a 3-pointer with 1:01 remaining. "We gave another game away," Phoenix center Shaquille O'Neal said. "We're not getting loose balls, and you can't have 16 turnovers. And you've got to stop somebody. You can't let a guy go for 52. It was not acceptable." Game notes  Portland forward  Ike Diogu  moved into the Blazers' regular 10-man rotation, replacing  Channing Frye .
