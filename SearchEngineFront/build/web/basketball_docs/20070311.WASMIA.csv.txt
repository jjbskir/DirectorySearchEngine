MIAMI --  Udonis Haslem 's 10-footer in the lane with 0.3 seconds left capped a wild back-and-forth game and gave the  Miami Heat  a 106-104 victory over the  Washington Wizards  on Sunday night.
 Elias Says The Wizards, who lost on a buzzer-beater by the Knicks' Steve Francis on Saturday night, are the second NBA team this season to lose back-to-back games, each on a field goal made with less than one second remaining. The Nets lost consecutive games of that type in January. But before this season, only team in the previous six seasons suffered two straight losses of that kind: Charlotte in February 2005.

The Heat blew a 16-point first-half lead, then rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to win their sixth straight overall and 12th straight at home -- plus get within one game of Washington in the Southeast Division. Eddie Jones  had 18 points and  Gary Payton  added a season-high 17 for the Heat, who had all eight players in their rotation score in double figures. Gilbert Arenas  scored 33 for the Wizards, including three free throws with 3.1 seconds left that tied the game.  Antawn Jamison  had a 26-point, 15-rebound effort for Washington, which lost at the buzzer for the second straight night when Haslem went to his right and scored the game-winner. Washington, which was out of timeouts, never got a desperation shot off before the final horn. Alonzo Mourning  had 16 points and  Shaquille O'Neal  -- limited to 17 minutes by foul trouble -- had 12 points for the Heat, while Haslem had 11 points and 10 rebounds.  Jason Williams  and  Antoine Walker  each had 11 points and  James Posey  added 10 for Miami, which hadn't had eight players reach double figures since Feb. 14, 1991. "You can't ask for more balance than that," Heat coach Pat Riley said. Brendan Haywood  had 12 points for the Wizards. Miami went up 104-101 with 4.1 seconds left, when Williams hit the first of two free throws. He missed the second -- the Heat went 10-for-25 from the line -- and that gave Washington a chance. The Wizards, naturally, went to Arenas, who was fouled by Payton in the right corner with 3.1 seconds left. Arenas hit all three, tying the game, but giving Miami more than enough time. The Heat went to Haslem, and the Miami native came through to keep the Heat's resurgence going. "We just wanted to get a look at it," Riley said. "And Udonis got a look at it. He made a  Dwyane Wade  shot ... just a great shot." Washington misfired on earlier last-second opportunities.  Caron Butler  was called for setting an illegal screen on Payton with 4.9 seconds left -- taking the ball out of Arenas' hands. With 38.6 seconds left, Arenas -- who was 12-for-12 at the line beforehand -- missed the first of two free throws and only brought Washington within 103-101. Miami led 28-14 after the opening quarter, forcing Washington into 10 straight missed shots over a six-minute stretch -- and building that edge despite O'Neal being limited to only two minutes because of foul trouble. Payton hit his first four shots, including a 3-pointer with 10:01 left in the half to stake Miami to a 33-18 lead. The margin hit 56-40 when Walker connected on a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left. But Arenas jumped past  Dorell Wright  and hit a running 3-pointer at the horn, cutting Miami's lead to 13 at the break -- and breathing life into the Wizards, who lost on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by the  New York Knicks '  Steve Francis  on Saturday night. That shot started what became a 40-12 run by Washington, which shot 72 percent in the third quarter while holding the Heat to a 30 percent clip in that period. Butler's dunk with 2:13 left in the third put the Wizards up 80-68, but Miami clawed its way back. Game notes  The Wizards are 8-30 all-time in Miami. ... Payton's previous season-high was 16 at New Jersey in November.
