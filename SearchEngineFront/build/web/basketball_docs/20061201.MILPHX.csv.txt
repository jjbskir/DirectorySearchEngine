 Shawn Marion  scored 27 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, and
grabbed 14 rebounds to help the Suns hold off  Michael Redd  and the
rest of the Bucks 122-116 on Friday night. The Suns beat Milwaukee at home for the 19th time in a row,
matching the longest active streak of its kind in the NBA. Denver
has lost 19 in a row at Sacramento. Milwaukee last won in Phoenix on Feb. 21, 1987. In the final 2:49, Marion made eight consecutive free throws and
blocked a driving layup by Redd. Redd finished with 37 points, giving him 82 in his last two
contests.  Mo Williams  added 31 points and 10 rebounds. "I thought the second half we played about as hard as we could
play and they were still scoring," Suns coach Mike D'Antoni said
of the Bucks. "When you have somebody like Michael Redd, he puts a
lot of pressure on you. He made some shots that were
unbelievable." 
 
 Elias Says 
 
 
 Redd Michael Redd scored 37 points and Mo Williams added 31, but the Bucks still lost at Phoenix 122-116. It's the first time this season that teammates each scored 30 or more points in a defeat. That happened 13 times last season. The last time Milwaukee lost a non-overtime game in which two of its players scored at least 30 points was on Feb. 2, 1983 -- Sidney Moncrief had 34 and Marques Johnson had 33 in a loss at Seattle.

Redd made 12 of 20 field goals and 12 of 15 free throws. "I'm trying to mix my game up," he said. "I'm really trying
to attack the rim, get to the free throw line, and it opens up my
jump shot. When you've got both of those clicking, it's pretty
tough to guard." Four players had at least 20 points apiece for Phoenix. Steve
Nash had 27 points and 11 assists.  Amare Stoudemire  had 22 points
and 11 rebounds before fouling out with 3:09 to play. Leandro
Barbosa had 20 points and  Raja Bell  18 for the Suns, who have won
eight of nine since a 1-5 start. "We've got lots of guys who can score," Nash said. "We're
only going to get better, hopefully, with our chemistry and
experience. Offense is not going to be our problem." Ruben Patterson  scored 10 of his 16 in the fourth quarter for
Milwaukee but fouled out with 2:49 to go. "It was a great game," Patterson said. "I don't want to say
anything about the officials. I don't want to get fined, but toward
the end, things just didn't go our way." The Suns led most of the second half, but never by more than 10
points. "I was proud of the way we played," Bucks coach Terry Stotts
said. "We hung tight. Some things didn't go our way. You hate to
put an effort like that out there and not come away with a win, but
we competed hard against a good team on the road. With two minutes
to go, anything could have happened." A pair of emphatic dunks by Stoudemire, one of them on a
three-point play, followed by Nash's free throw on a technical foul
against  Andrew Bogut  for tripping, put Phoenix ahead 111-103 with
4  minutes to go. The Bucks cut it to 115-112 on two free throws by  Ersan Ilyasova 
with 58 seconds to go, but Marion made four straight free throws to
seal the victory. "I thought in the second half we were better, tougher," Nash
said. "We might not have gotten too many more stops, but just the
couple that you need." Milwaukee scored the final four points of the first half and
first five of the second to go up 69-62 on Redd's 3-pointer. The Suns mounted a 15-2 run to take an 80-74 lead on Nash's
18-footer with 6:03 left in the third quarter. Redd's 22-footer cut
it to 91-87, but Phoenix scored the final six points of the
quarter, capped by Bell's 3-pointer, and led 97-87 entering the
fourth. The Bucks shot 62 percent (28-for-45) and the Suns 54 percent
(25-46) in a mostly defenseless first half that ended with
Milwaukee up 64-62. Game notes The Suns last had five players with at least 20 points
apiece when they scored 173 points against Denver on Nov. 10, 1990.
