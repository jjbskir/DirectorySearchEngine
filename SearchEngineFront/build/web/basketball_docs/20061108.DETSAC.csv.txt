SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --  Kevin Martin  and  Mike Bibby  scored most of the points, yet the  Sacramento Kings  wouldn't have won without a vintage effort from the Big Nasty. Martin equaled his career high with 30 points and  Corliss Williamson  scored 13 of his 15 in the second half against his former team, leading the Kings to a 99-86 victory Wednesday night. With center  Brad Miller  sidelined by a foot injury, Sacramento got an unlikely second-half boost from Williamson in its third victory in four games. The Big Nasty, as he became known as the Final Four MVP with Arkansas, was on the Pistons' 2004 championship team, but barely played for Sacramento last season. "It just feels good to do it," Williamson said. "That's a good team we were playing, so that makes it more fun, too." Williamson, who also was the NBA's top sixth man with Detroit in 2002, scored six points during Sacramento's decisive run in the fourth quarter after Martin scored 14 points in the third. "It put a smile on a lot of people's faces to see him get in there and have a game like that," Martin said of Williamson, who has remained a steady leadership presence even without playing time under former coach Rick Adelman. Bibby had 23 points -- including the 10,000th of his career -- and seven rebounds for the Kings, who snapped a three-game losing streak to Detroit. Chauncey Billups  scored 25 points and  Richard Hamilton  had 20 for Detroit, which has dropped the first two games of a four-game West Coast road trip in particularly disappointing fashion. "Right now we're not a very good basketball team," Billups said. "We've got a long way to go. We're having too many breakdowns. We're not starting off with the urgency we need. We need to get the lead and step on people." Instead, they got stepped on -- particularly  Rasheed Wallace . Kenny Thomas  led the defensive effort as the Kings held Wallace scoreless on 0-for-9 shooting in 37 minutes of action, though he grabbed 15 rebounds.  Tayshaun Prince  also floundered against the newly defense-minded Kings, managing just six points while going 3-for-13. "It was one of those things," Wallace said. "You can't stop shooting. You can't stop playing. We were missing those bunnies (easy shots), as my high school coach used to say." Ron Artest  had 10 points and nine rebounds in his first game against the Pistons since inciting the infamous brawl at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Nov. 19, 2004, when he was with the  Indiana Pacers . Artest was suspended for the rest of the 2004-05 season for entering the stands to scrap with a fan, then was traded to Sacramento last January. But Artest has no apparent quarrel with any Pistons now that nemesis  Ben Wallace  has left the club for Chicago: He exchanged warm greetings with the Detroit players before the opening tip. Detroit got off to a horrific start, going 2-for-14 with six turnovers in the first nine minutes. Hamilton had four of the Pistons' five field goals in the first quarter, and Detroit missed 23 of its first 28 shots. Sacramento took an early 14-point lead but also struggled, eventually falling behind before taking the lead for good on eight straight points by Martin midway through the third quarter. The Kings opened the fourth quarter with a 15-7 run and maintained a healthy lead. "We're not playing in a very good rhythm right now," Detroit coach Flip Saunders said. "We're not playing with any emotion. Even when we took a five-point lead, we weren't playing with any confidence." Before the Pistons beat Sacramento last season in the Kings' home opener, the Arco Arena scoreboard flashed pictures of abandoned buildings, burned-out cars, piles of rubble and other negative images of Detroit. The Kings apologized profusely for the insult, with owners Joe and Gavin Maloof taking out full-page ads in Detroit's two major newspapers. Game notes  The Kings visit the Palace on Jan. 20. ...
