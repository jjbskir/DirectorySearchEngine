PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- If  Brandon Roy  is any indication, the  Portland Trail Blazers  won't have to worry about getting overconfident riding their six-game win streak. "In this league it's great to get a string of wins, but you have to stay consistent," Roy said. "We don't want to get too excited -- but we are thrilled." Roy scored 29 points,  Travis Outlaw  had 21 and Portland beat the  Utah Jazz  99-91 on Friday night, giving the Trail Blazers their longest win streak since an eight-game run in 2002. The Rose Garden crowd erupted as  Jarrett Jack  dribbled out the last few seconds of the win. "We're not backing down from anybody and we keep finding ways to win," Blazers center  Joel Przybilla  said. "Everyone keeps stepping up." Nobody is stepping up for the Jazz, who lost their sixth straight and second in a week to their division rival. "It seems like it comes down to the last 4 or 5 minutes," said  Carlos Boozer , who led Utah with 22 points, 12 rebounds and six assists before fouling out. "I felt like we had a chance to win all six of them but for some reason we can't win. Maybe we're making the wrong mistakes and not getting the right stops." The Blazers had been shooting better than 50 percent and averaging 107.4 points during the streak. They shot just 44 percent against the Jazz and were outrebounded by 11, but made 37 of 46 free throws. Andrei Kirilenko  had 16 points and eight rebounds for the Jazz, who last lost six in a row in 2005.  Ronnie Brewer  had 13 points and  Deron Williams  had 11 points and 10 assists. Outlaw, averaging 18.8 points over the past five games, continued his torrid play off the bench and scored 11 of his points in the fourth quarter. An intentional foul call on Williams late in the game proved costly for the Jazz. Outlaw made two free throws before Roy cut through the lane to put the Blazers up 91-86 with just under 2 minutes left. Boozer made one of two free throws on the other end, but Outlaw hit a 10-footer and then grabbed a rebound off a Boozer miss to help seal the win. The Blazers are 9-3 this year at the Rose Garden, where they play seven of their next eight. Utah center  Mehmet Okur  sat out for the second game with a possible strained left trapezius. Coach Jerry Sloan started  Jarron Collins  at center, after going with 6-foot-8  Paul Millsap  on Wednesday against Phoenix. But Collins wasn't very productive in 16 minutes, and Sloan switched to a small lineup, with Boozer in the middle. It didn't seem to work out. The Jazz took 94 shots but made just 39 percent, and many were long jumpers with plenty of time left on the shot clock. The Jazz were 0-of-13 on 3-pointers, and Brewer, Williams and Kirilenko combined to go 16-of-46 from the field. "We have to use a little more patience and try to get the ball inside," Sloan said. "We have to try and make them play offense for more than two or three seconds." Portland led 45-37 late in the second quarter, but the Jazz outscored Portland 17-8 to take a one-point advantage at the break. The Jazz threatened to pull away in the third. Brewer finished a break with a layup, Boozer hit a 15-footer and Williams converted a driving layup to give Utah an 11-point lead. But Portland went on an 8-0 run that Roy capped with a fadeaway jumper. The Jazz went scoreless for the first three minutes of the fourth and the Blazers went ahead 75-74 on a jumper from Jones. LaMarcus Aldridge , the Blazers' leading scorer and rebounder, missed his third game with plantar fasciitis. He said Thursday that he expects to play in the Blazers' next home game Monday against New Orleans. Game notes  Utah G  Jason Hart  was excused from the team to attend a funeral. ... Portland F  Martell Webster  played despite the stomach flu, which kept him out of Portland's last game. He took intravenous fluids before tipoff and had 10 points. ... Okur has an MRI exam scheduled for Saturday. ... The Jazz recalled C  Kyrylo Fesenko  from the Utah Flash of the NBA Developmental League on Thursday. He played 4 1/2 minutes and didn't score.
