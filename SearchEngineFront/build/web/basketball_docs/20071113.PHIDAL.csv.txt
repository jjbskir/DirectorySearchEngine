DALLAS (AP) --  Jason Terry  passed up some open first-half shots for the  Dallas Mavericks , and he heard about it at halftime from  Avery Johnson . Terry heeded his coach's advice, scoring 12 of his 25 points during Dallas' big third-quarter run, and the Mavericks rallied to beat the  Philadelphia 76ers  99-84 on Tuesday night. "He passed up three shots early in the game," Johnson said. "I had to remind him he's the Microwave, not the Toaster." Terry went 8-for-13 from the floor in the second half, 3-for-6 from 3-point range, to help the Mavericks remain unbeaten at home this season (3-0). "I know my job, but [Johnson] reminded me," said Terry, who came off the bench in the first half but started the third quarter. "He told me specifically to be more aggressive." Dirk Nowitzki  added 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Mavericks, who bounced back from Saturday night's 91-82 road loss to the  Portland Trail Blazers . Nowitzki also matched a career high with eight assists, passing out of double-teams to open teammates. Nowitzki was looking for his first career triple-double, and he kiddingly blamed Terry after the game for missing a few open shots that would have been assists for the German star. "It's not Playstation, it's not going to be that easy," Nowitzki said. "But we did a good job sharing the ball and moving it around to the open guy." Dallas shot 35 percent from the field and got a season-low 11 points from Nowitzki on Saturday night against Portland. The Mavericks upped it to 45 percent shooting against Philadelphia, with Nowitzki going 7-for-14 from the floor. Josh Howard  added 18 points for Dallas. Andre Iguodala  had 15 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists for Philadelphia, which has lost three straight.  Samuel Dalembert  finished with a season-high 18 points and  Willie Green  added a season-best 16. The Sixers led 50-43 at halftime after outrebounding Dallas 28-23 in the first half. But Philadelphia couldn't sustain its energy level as Dallas came out strong in the second half. "I thought we played well the first 40 minutes but Dallas capitalized on all our mistakes," Green said. "Their big players stepped up and hit big shots and we fell apart at the end." The Mavericks got 11 of their first 16 third-quarter points off fast breaks and Terry made a pair of 3s during a 23-11 run that put Dallas in front 66-61. "It was all energy," said Nowitzki, who also had three blocked shots and two steals. "It started defensively. We wanted to make their shots hard. We wanted to speed the game up." The Mavericks scored the first seven points of the third to tie it at 50, the last two baskets by Terry. Dallas also clamped down on the defensive end during early run with blocked shots from Nowitzki and  DeSagana Diop  on consecutive possessions. "We knew [the Mavericks] were going to come out and push the ball in the second half," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. Terry's 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter capped an 8-2 run, putting the Mavericks in front 84-70, and the 76ers were unable to get closer than 12 points the rest of the way.
