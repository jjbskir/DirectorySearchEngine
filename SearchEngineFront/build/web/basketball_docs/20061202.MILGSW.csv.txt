OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Don Nelson will have to wait for his
1,200th coaching victory -- again. Although the  Milwaukee Bucks  had every opportunity to fold, they
were unwilling to become a footnote in the history of their
franchise's winningest coach. Mo Williams  scored 10 points in the fourth quarter after missing
his first 12 shots of the game, and the Bucks roared from behind
for an improbable 115-110 victory over the  Golden State Warriors  on
Saturday night. Charlie Bell  fell just short of his career high with 28 points
for the Bucks, who ruined Nelson's second attempt to become just
the second coach in NBA history with 1,200 career victories.
Although Nelson has won hundreds of games for both of these
franchises, he couldn't inspire his Warriors to exhibit the same
poise shown by the Bucks. "When things are not going our way, we don't get down,"
Milwaukee coach Terry Stotts said. "We come together. We have a
certain resilience. I like our competitive nature." The Bucks' defense has been awful all season, but Milwaukee held
Golden State scoreless in the final 2:54, scoring seven straight
points on free throws and Williams' go-ahead jumper with 53 seconds
left. Michael Redd  scored 24 points and  Ruben Patterson  added 18
points and eight rebounds in the Bucks' second impressive win
during their four-game road trip, following a victory over the
Lakers on Tuesday night. "We deserved this win," said Redd, who encouraged Williams in
the second half and then hugged his fellow starting guard after the
buzzer. "I really like the effort we've put in the last three
games on the road." Troy Murphy  hit a career-high five 3-pointers while scoring 23
points for the Warriors, who finished a lengthy stretch of home
games with an embarrassing collapse.  Baron Davis  and  Monta Ellis 
added 19 points apiece and Davis added 11 assists. After trailing for most of the second half, Milwaukee went ahead
108-107 with 3:09 to play on two free throws by Williams, who
couldn't even make a shot until hitting a jumper midway through the
fourth quarter. Ellis hit a 3-pointer to put Golden State back
ahead, but Williams hit his short jumper in the lane. "I just wanted to stay with it," Williams said. "I can sleep
now. Well, I can sleep with one eye open now. You've got to be
mentally strong." After Davis missed a jumper, Williams hit one free throw and
missed the second with 13.7 seconds left -- but Golden State's Matt
Barnes clumsily knocked the rebound out of bounds, allowing Redd to
get two more free throws that put Milwaukee up by four. Andrew
Bogut then drew an offensive foul to essentially end it. Andris Biedrins  had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Warriors,
but Davis is displeased by his club's tendency to play to the
opposition's level. "The San Antonios and the Utahs, you're going to get up for
those games," Davis said of the two teams beaten by Golden State
on this four-game homestand. "The challenge is bringing that same
intensity and focus for teams like Indiana and Milwaukee coming in
here on back-to-backs." Nelson, who's now in his second term on the Warriors' bench, has
a long and colorful history with both franchises. While sometimes
wearing ties painted to look like fish, Nelson won 540 games, seven
consecutive division titles and two awards as the NBA's coach of
the year in 11 seasons with the Bucks, but never claimed the
championship that has eluded him to this day. "We had some costly turnovers in the end that cost us the
game," Nelson said. "It's really hard to come away with the close
wins when the other team gets to the (free throw) line almost twice
as many times as we did." After barely missing the milestone in a last-second loss to
Indiana on Wednesday night, Nelson probably won't get his 1,200th
victory in Oakland: After playing 11 of their last 12 games at
home, the Warriors play nine of their next 12 away from Oracle
Arena. Golden State swingman  Jason Richardson , who left the loss to
Indiana at halftime with soreness in his surgically repaired left
knee, started and scored six points but sat out the fourth
quarter. Game notes Golden State G  Anthony Roberson  sprained his left thumb in
the second quarter, but X-rays were negative. ... Milwaukee

went 0-for-6 and committed three fouls in 19 minutes for Golden
State.
