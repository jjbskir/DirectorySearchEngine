INDIANAPOLIS (AP) --  Stephen Jackson  didn't let his outside issues distract him. Jackson scored a season-high 26 points to lead the  Indiana Pacers  to a 94-80 victory over the  Orlando Magic  on Wednesday night. He began the day at a court hearing in which a judge set a Feb. 12 trial date on charges that Jackson fired a gun during a fight outside a strip club. "I wish I wasn't in court, but I have to deal with what's going on," Jackson said. "It definitely brings everything to your face and makes you more humble about stuff -- I appreciate the game of basketball every time I step out there." Al Harrington  had 26 points,  Jermaine O'Neal  added 11 points and 11 rebounds, and  Jeff Foster  grabbed 18 rebounds for the Pacers (10-10), who returned home after losing their final three games of a six-game road trip to the West Coast. "It's good to be home, especially when you're out for so long," O'Neal said. "We're just trying to get our bodies back used to being on East Coast time." Dwight Howard  had 20 points, eight rebounds and three blocks, and  Grant Hill  scored 16 for the Eastern Conference-leading Magic (14-6), who suffered their second loss at Indiana this season. "We can't blame it on the trip," said Magic coach Brian Hill, whose team finished 4-2 on its six-game road swing. "The Pacers had a lot of energy tonight." In the first quarter, it was Hill's 14 points on 7-of-7 shooting that helped the Magic stay close. Orlando tied the score at 25 late in the period on a Hill layup, but  Danny Granger 's 3-pointer put the Pacers back in front. In the second quarter, the teams traded baskets early before Indiana took control. The Pacers ended the first half with an 11-4 run, which included Jackson's acrobatic layup over Orlando's  Tony Battie  with less than a minute left, giving Indiana a 52-42 lead at the break. Orlando cut the deficit to 62-55 following Howard's layup midway through the third quarter, but the Pacers pushed their lead to 76-59 after scoring 14 of the final 18 points of the period. Indiana, which allowed the Magic to get within 84-72 with less than five minutes left in the game, got an O'Neal basket and consecutive jumpers by Jackson to seal the victory. "We wanted to start this home stretch off on a good note by winning," Jackson said. "I think the biggest thing was that we came out focused because we needed a win more than they did." Game notes  The Pacers improved to 5-1 against Orlando in their past six games dating to last season, including winning two of three this year. "You want to set a tone and leave some doubt in those guys' mind that they can't beat us," O'Neal said. "Hopefully, that wears on their mind going down the stretch of the season." ...
