MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Kevin Durant  and the  Oklahoma City Thunder  found out they could win a tough game in the fourth quarter. They learned that right after they figured out how to blow a big lead in the third quarter. Durant had 32 points and 10 rebounds to help the Thunder beat the  Memphis Grizzlies  102-94 on Friday night after they squandered what had been a 17-point lead in the first half. The Thunder missed 17-of-20 shots in the third quarter and were outscored 28-10, giving the Grizzlies a 70-66 lead entering the fourth. "That was one of the toughest third quarters we've played," Durant said. "That's a test that I think we passed. We came out in the fourth quarter against a good team and got the win." Russell Westbrook  scored 10 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter,  Nenad Krstic  finished with 15 points and  Jeff Green  added 11 to help the Thunder snap the Grizzlies' three-game winning streak. Oklahoma City has won three of four. Zach Randolph  had 19 points and 20 rebounds for Memphis,  Mike Conley  scored 20 points and  O.J. Mayo  added 18. Rudy Gay  scored 16 points but was 4-of-16 from the field. Memphis also hurt its chances by going 14-of-24 from the free-throw line. "You've got to make free throws," Memphis coach Lionel Hollins said. "We lost by eight and missed 10 free throws. If we make eight, we're tied and into overtime. If we make nine, we win the game." Randolph's 13 rebounds in the third set a Grizzlies record for rebounds in a quarter. Oklahoma City scored 10 consecutive points in the middle of the fourth to regain the lead. Westbrook's 3-pointer put Oklahoma City up 86-75 lead with five minutes left, and Memphis couldn't recover. "We just plan ran out of gas," Conley said.
