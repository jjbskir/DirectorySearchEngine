CHICAGO -- There was little drama during the game but plenty
of it afterward. 	   The  Chicago Bulls  wasted no time putting away New York, moving a
step closer to securing the second seed in the Eastern Conference
by handing the Knicks their most lopsided loss of the season, 98-69
on Tuesday night. 	   Then, things got tense. 	    Nate Robinson ,  Jerome James  and  Steve Francis  had words with the
Bulls'  Tyrus Thomas  afterward. And James had to be restrained from
going after him in the hallway. 	   "I think they were definitely trying to rub it in," said Eddy
Curry, who spent his first four seasons with the Bulls. "But we'll
see them next year." 	   Fans get free Big Macs if the Bulls score 100. Chicago's Chris
Duhon acknowledged they were trying to feed spectators but denied
trying to run up the score.  Thabo Sefolosha  missed a 3-pointer with
1:04 left, and Duhon missed two in the final minute.  Malik Allen 
also missed a layup with 10 seconds left. 	   "We just wanted to do something for the fans," Duhon said. "I
don't cook, so I wanted one myself. We certainly didn't mean any
disrespect." 	   The Knicks didn't see it that way, though. 	   "As a veteran, I have been in the league long enough, and I
know when people are trying to run up the score on you," Francis
said. "And I told their players, if I was in the game, it would've
been something different. If it was a threat or whatever, I'm a
veteran. I won't do that to nobody, and I don't expect nobody to
try to do that to younger players on my team, so that's what it
was." 	   Second in the Eastern Conference, the Bulls (47-32) lead
fifth-place Cleveland by a half-game and Atlantic Division winner
Toronto by 1 1/2. Chicago owns the tiebreaker over both teams and has
clinched home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. 	   The Bulls still have an outside shot at the No. 1 seed, but one
more loss by Chicago or a win by Detroit would clinch it for the
Pistons. 	   "We did well to put that game away early," said  Luol Deng , who
scored 15 points. "It's a good win. It's important because we want
to finish second. Now, we just have to focus on our next
opponent." 	    Ben Gordon  scored 23 points, and the Bulls turned 25 turnovers
into 30 points. 	   The Bulls and Cleveland appeared to be in a two-team race for
the second seed, with the loser dropping to fifth. But with Toronto
on a roll, the third seed is also a possibility. 	   Robinson scored 24 points for New York (32-46), which lost for
the sixth time in seven games. Curry committed two offensive fouls
in the opening 1:44 and finished with just four points and seven
rebounds. 	   With four games left, the 10th-place Knicks still have a remote
shot at the postseason, but they have to climb over Orlando and
Indiana to grab a playoff spot. Against Chicago, they were simply
overmatched. 	   Four of the Knicks' top five scorers -- guard  Stephon Marbury 
(sprained right big toe), guard  Jamal Crawford  (right ankle stress
fracture), forward  Quentin Richardson  (back surgery) and forward
 David Lee  (right leg pain) -- were nursing injuries. New York was
also without forward  Renaldo Balkman , who stayed home with a
stomach virus and missed his second consecutive game. 	   Things quickly unraveled against the Bulls. 	   Curry, New York's leading scorer, headed to the sideline after
picking up those offensive fouls. The Knicks committed seven
turnovers in the first 4:01. New York also missed nine of its first
10 shots, which probably explains why Curry checked back in midway
through the quarter with the score 12-2. 	   It was 21-10 after the first quarter and 45-27 at halftime. 	   "I have never been accused of running up the score," Bulls
coach Scott Skiles said. "From everything I hear, the Knicks are
on the verge of becoming a great team. So they are probably a team
we will be playing over and over again the years to come. Something
like this should not fester." 	   But Curry accused his former coach of doing just that. Asked if
he was surprised Skiles would allow the Bulls to run up the score,
Curry said, "No, I'm not. I'm not surprised."
