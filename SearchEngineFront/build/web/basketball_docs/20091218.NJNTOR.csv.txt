TORONTO -- The  New Jersey Nets  are making life easy on their opponents. Amir Johnson  scored a season-high 18 points,  Chris Bosh  had 16 points and eight rebounds, and the  Toronto Raptors  easily dispatched the Nets 118-95 Friday night. "They got whatever they wanted," New Jersey swingman  Chris Douglas-Roberts  said. "That's how teams are going to start looking at us, if they haven't already. You will get whatever you want on the Nets. That's how I'd be looking at us." Toronto finished with a dozen dunks and led by 40, extending New Jersey's losing streak to six games. The Nets are 2-25 overall, the worst record in the NBA. "We jumped on them first and they let up," Toronto guard  Jarrett Jack  said. "When you start off 0-18, uphill battle is kind of an understatement. You kind of see it on their faces that if they get down early, they're kind of like 'Here we go again." Andrea Bargnani  and  DeMar DeRozan  each scored 16 points while  Hedo Turkoglu  and  Marcus Banks  each had 14 for the Raptors, who had lost four of five coming in. Nets guard  Devin Harris  called it an "embarrassment." "We've all been a part of these games and it's not fun," Harris said. "I don't like sitting on the bench in the fourth quarter." Sonny Weems  scored 10 points and Jack had nine assists for Toronto. "Our guys, from the jump ball, did a great job," Raptors coach Jay Triano said. "We pressured the basketball, caused turnovers and had more deflections tonight than we have had all year." Douglas-Roberts returned to the starting lineup after missing three games with a sore left knee and scored 16 points.  Brook Lopez  scored 14 and  Rafer Alston  had 13. Courtney Lee  scored 11 and  Sean Williams  had 10 for New Jersey. "This was one of those games, and I've been through a number of them, where we had no energy on either side of the ball," Nets coach Kiki Vandeweghe said. "It was no fun tonight, no fun to coach, no fun to play." Losers of eight of their past 10, things won't get any easier for the Nets, who host the defending NBA champion Lakers on Saturday night. "You always hear 'It could always get worse," Douglas-Roberts said. "It can. If that's the mindset we come out with, it could get worse." With Toronto up 94-60 after three quarters, the Raptors' starters spent the rest of the night resting up for Sunday's home game against New Orleans. The Nets committed 16 turnovers in the opening half and made just one free throw, while Toronto had only two turnovers and went 13 for 19 at the line. New Jersey trailed 70-33 at halftime, the lowest total Toronto has held an opponent to this season. "There's a lot of different things that are going wrong out there," Harris said. "We're not shooting the ball well, we're turning it over and then we're not getting back on defense and they're getting dunks. We're facing a lot of different hurdles."
