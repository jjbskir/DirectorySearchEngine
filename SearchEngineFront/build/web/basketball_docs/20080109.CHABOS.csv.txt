BOSTON (AP) -- Hardly anyone except for maybe Charlotte's  Jason Richardson  could have seen this coming. 	   The  Boston Celtics  were rolling at home and the Bobcats were
miserable on the road. Taking The Fourth The Celtics' run to break the all-time record for wins in a season hit a snag Wednesday with their fourth loss. Here's the list of teams with the most wins before a fourth loss:  Team Wins Final rec. 
 1995-96 Bulls 41 72-10 
 1971-72 Lakers 39 69-13 
 1966-67 76ers 37 68-13 
 2007-08 Celtics 29 ? 
 

 	   Richardson had 34 points and nine rebounds,  Gerald Wallace  had
15 points and 10 rebounds, and the Bobcats stunned the Celtics
95-83 for just their fourth loss of the season on Wednesday night. 	   "I'm not surprised because we're a pretty good team,"
Richardson said. "It just doesn't show in our record." 	   And it really didn't when they played on the road. 	   The Bobcats, who entered with an Eastern Conference-worst 1-11
road mark, also got 16 points and eight assists from 
 Raymond Felton . But it was Richardson, who went 14-for-22 from the floor,
that hurt the Celtics most. 	   "Jason Richardson was fantastic, just tremendous," Boston
coach Doc Rivers said. 	   The loss snapped a nine-game winning streak for Boston (29-4)
and spoiled its bid for the fastest start in team history to 30
wins. The 1959-60 Celtics started 30-4 before going on to win the
NBA title. 	    Kevin Garnett  led Boston with 24 points and eight rebounds.  Paul Pierce  scored 13 points on just 4-for-14 shooting. 	   "We aren't going to win every game of the season," Pierce
said. "We have to expect everybody's best, and it was one of
Charlotte's best games." 	   The Celtics' only other loss at home came when Detroit's
 Chauncey Billups  hit two free throws with 0.1 seconds left in an
87-85 win on Dec. 19. Boston is 16-2 at the TD Banknorth Garden. 	   Richardson hit some keys shots when Boston tried to mount a
comeback, many coming late in the shot clock. 	   "I thought our offense was pretty effective and Jason
Richardson just got hot and made some big shots," Bobcats coach
Sam Vincent said. "The bottom line was that there was a
better-focused effort of getting the ball to the rim, and getting
to the bucket instead of settling for outside shots." 	   Boston hit just 42 percent of its shots. 	   "It was our execution," Rivers said. "It was our defensive
execution. But listen, guys, we scored 83 points, too, you know. We
have a better offensive team." 	   The Bobcats led 72-65 after three quarters and opened it to
81-70 on Richardson's layup with 7:08 to play. Boston pulled to
83-76 on Pierce's three-point play, but Richardson hit two free
throws and  Nazr Mohammed  had a pair of baskets inside to keep the
lead safe. 	   Boston never moved closer than seven points in the final 5
minutes. 	   The Celtics looked like they were in for another easy night at
home when they opened a 35-24 edge midway into the second half, but
the Bobcats responded by scoring the next 14 points en route to a
45-41 halftime edge. 	   Charlotte trailed 63-61 late in the third quarter before closing
with an 11-2 spree that was highlighted by Wallace's breakaway
windmill jam, giving the Bobcats a 65-53 lead. Garnett scored 14
points in the quarter and Richardson 11. 	   Charlotte lost the previous game between the teams at home on
Nov. 24 when  Ray Allen  hit a 3 at the buzzer. Game notes  Allen was sidelined with a pinched nerve in his neck.
Rivers said before the game, "Clearly if it was a playoff game
he'd be playing. He felt great today." ... Celtics F  Glen Davis 
also missed the game, sidelined with a sore right knee. ...
Charlotte F  Jared Dudley , who played his college ball at Boston
College, made his first return trip to the TD Banknorth Garden and
had a pair of former Eagles teammates, Tyrese Rice and Shamari
Spears, on hand to see him. ... The Bobcats were coming off a
season-high 115 points in their win over New Jersey at home on
Tuesday.
