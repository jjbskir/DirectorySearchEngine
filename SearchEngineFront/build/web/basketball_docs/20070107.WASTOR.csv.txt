TORONTO (AP) --  Dirk Nowitzki  had 38 points and  Josh Howard  made
a go-ahead layup with 0.9 seconds left to rally the Dallas
Mavericks past the  Toronto Raptors  97-96 on Sunday. With Nowitzki triple-teamed, Howard made a wide-open layup to
give Dallas the lead. Toronto's  Anthony Parker  missed a 3-pointer
at the buzzer. Nowitzki had 11 rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two
steals for the Mavericks, winners of 17 of their last 18 games. Chris Bosh  had 24 points and 15 rebounds, but his turnover after
winning a jump ball set up the Maverick's last play with 6.5
seconds left. After the Mavericks inbounded the ball, three players
converged on Nowitzki, allowing Howard to stand under the basket
uncovered. Toronto led nearly the entire game, with Dallas briefly taking
the lead with just over two minutes left and for good on Howard's
layup. The Raptors led by as many as 16, but Nowitzki scored eight
straight points to start the fourth to cut the lead to three.
Nowitzki's two layups cut it to one with 34.4 seconds left. Toronto led by 11 at halftime and lost despite shooting 48.6
percent from the field. T.J. Ford  had 16 points and eight assists. ^Notes:@  Morris Peterson , Toronto's franchise leader in games,
