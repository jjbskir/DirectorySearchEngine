BOSTON (AP) -- Celtics point guard  Sebastian Telfair  had spent
the last few days trying to downplay the significance of playing
against his former team for the first time. But after recording 15 points and seven assists to lead Boston
over the  Portland Trail Blazers  on Friday night, Telfair couldn't
help but let out a sigh of relief. "If felt good," said Telfair, who was the centerpiece of an
offseason five-player trade that sent him from Portland to Boston.
"I'd be lying if I said it didn't. I wouldn't say it was like
revenge or anything -- I'm not holding a grudge that bad. But I'm
happy that we went out there and played the way we did." Paul Pierce  scored 29 points and  Wally Szczerbiak  added 19 for
the Celtics, who have won two straight after starting the season
1-6. Boston, which outscored Indiana 67-43 in the second half of its
114-88 win on Wednesday, outscored Portland 68-47 in the second
half Friday. Pierce scored 12 points in the third quarter to help the Celtics
take a 77-65 lead.  Delonte West  then scored 13 of his 17 points on
5-of-6 shooting in the fourth quarter as Boston scored on its first
10 possessions of the period to put the game out of reach. "Really frustrating," Portland forward  Zach Randolph  said.
"We were in the game in the first and second quarters. Second half
we came out and we couldn't bounce back. Pierce came down hit big
shots, and from there we just fell in the hole." None of Boston's starters had to play in the fourth quarter, as
the Celtics' second unit pushed the lead to 35 at one point. Randolph had 23 points and 12 rebounds and  Ime Udoka  added 14
points for the Blazers, who have lost four straight after getting
off to a surprising 4-2 start. "We're not playing good basketball right now," Portland coach
Nate McMillan said. "We are giving up points way too easy and then
you start searching for people that can help you, and the only
people that can help you are yourselves." Telfair, who averaged 8.1 points and 3.5 assists in two seasons
with Portland, helped Boston take control early. Telfair scored 13 points in the first half as Boston jumped out
to a 50-43 lead. He had six points and three assists in the second
quarter as Boston outscored Portland 30-23. "I was honestly worried about Sebastian going into this game
because usually young players playing against their (former) team
want to show them they made a mistake," Boston coach Doc Rivers
said. "And he didn't do that at all, so that was really nice." Pierce's layup with 1:59 remaining in the half broke a 39-all
tie, then Telfair assisted on Szczerbiak's 3-pointer to push the
lead to 44-39. Boston never trailed again. After shooting just 2-of-9 in the first half, Randolph scored
Portland's first five points of the second half to help the Trail
Blazers pull within 52-51. But Szczerbiak scored seven points
during an 8-0 run to help the Celtics extend their lead to 60-51. The Trail Blazers then clawed back to 62-58 with 4:36 remaining
in the third, but Pierce extended Boston's lead with a 3-pointer on
the other end. Boston outscored Portland 41-25 in the fourth quarter. Game notes Boston center  Michael Olowokandi  will be sidelined two to
