EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- For one of the few times this season, the  New Jersey Nets  won with defense instead of their stars. Sure,  Jason Kidd  recorded his 81st career triple-double and  Nenad Krstic  had 26 points and a season-high 14 rebounds, but the key for the Nets on Monday night was a fourth-quarter defense that limited the  Golden State Warriors  to 13 points in a 105-97 win.

 "In the fourth quarter we were significantly better defensively," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "We made them play in the halfcourt and we put together consecutive stops." In the opening seven minutes of the final quarter, New Jersey held the Warriors to 2 of 10 shooting from the field and forced four turnovers in turning an eight-point deficit into a seven-point lead. "I think we paid attention. There weren't any mental breakdowns," Kidd said of the defensive effort. "Every one helped. There was talk. We need that in the fourth quarter." Kidd finished with 10 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds and the Nets broke a two-game losing streak, winning for the fifth time in 16 games. The triple-double was the sixth of the season for the Nets point guard. Richard Jefferson  added 15 points and  Vince Carter  had 11 for New Jersey, which took control of the game with a 19-4 spurt to open the fourth. Little used  Bostjan Nachbar  had nine of his 13 points in the final quarter. Baron Davis  led the Warriors with 25 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, but he only had three in the final quarter.  Monta Ellis  added 19 points and  Mike Dunleavy  had 18 off the bench. "That's where we lost the game, the fourth quarter," Davis said after the Warriors lost their eighth straight on the road. "We hit an offensive wall and stopped moving the ball and running. It was due in large part because we didn't come up with any loose balls, any deflections or any of those long rebounds. They beat us to the punch in the fourth quarter. It was like they wanted it a little more." The Warriors took an 84-78 lead into the final quarter and expanded the margin to eight when Dunleavy got a rebound and drove the length of the court for a layup. Backup point guard  Marcus Williams  stripped Davis of the ball on the next possession and scored on a layup, igniting the Nets' spurt.  Mikki Moore  got New Jersey within 86-84 with a layup and two free throws. Dunleavy pushed the Warriors' margin to 88-84 with a jumper, but Golden State was outscored 13-0 over the next four-plus minutes. Two more free throws by Moore and a layup by Nachbar eventually tied the game. Nachbar's free throw a minute later put New Jersey ahead 89-88. Jefferson then hit a jumper and two free throws after stealing the ball from Davis for a 93-88 lead with six minutes to play. A layup by Nachbar and two free throws by Carter pushed the margin to 97-88 and Golden State couldn't close the gap. "They are a good halfcourt defensive team," Davis said. "That's what coach told us before the game. We just played right into their hands in the fourth." Game notes New Jersey native  Troy Murphy  missed his fifth straight game with a sore left foot. ...
