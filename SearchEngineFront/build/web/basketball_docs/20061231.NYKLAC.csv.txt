LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When he wasn't scoring,  Elton Brand  was
making it difficult for the  New York Knicks  to put points on the
board. Brand had 32 points and tied his career high with eight blocked
shots, leading the  Los Angeles Clippers  to a 90-80 victory over the
Knicks on Sunday. "Our defense is what we prided ourselves in last year, and
that's what kept us in ballgames," Brand said. "So we've got to
be out there blocking shots, deflecting balls and rebounding.
That's how we win." The Knicks never led in their fifth straight road loss. They
shot 29.5 percent in the first half, 34.5 percent for the game, and
had 16 shots blocked by the aggressive Clippers. "I don't think it had anything to do with our legs being tired.
We were just poor with our execution," Knicks center  David Lee 
said. "We don't have one of those guys who's going to score 50
points on his own, so we need to really work hard, execution-wise,
and have all five guys in the right spots and moving the right
way." Brand scored 15 points in the first 7:17 of the game and didn't
make another field goal until his tip-in of  Cuttino Mobley 's missed
12-footer with 7:09 left in the third quarter. But Brand blocked
seven shots during that drought, helping the Clippers increase
their 13-point halftime lead to 62-45. "Whenever we tried to move the ball to the weak side, we had
poor spacing. And when we drove the ball, it was contested and we
had to take tough shots," Knicks coach Isiah Thomas said. "It's
tough right now because we don't have a lot of shooters on the
floor." Mardy Collins  returned to the Knicks' lineup after serving a
six-game suspension and scored 11 points in 22 minutes. It was the
rookie guard's flagrant foul against Denver's  J.R. Smith  that
triggered a brawl at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 16, resulting in
the ejection of all 10 players on the court at the time and
additional suspensions for teammates  Nate Robinson  (10 games),
 Jared Jeffries  (four) and  Jerome James  (one). "Anytime you sit out for a number of games, you always want to
get back out there and play," Collins said. "The NBA decided that
six games was enough, so I just had to deal with it. We're still
short-handed at guard, so it's time for me to get some playing
time, show people that I'm not that type of player, and I can
actually play basketball the right way." New York is 4-3 since the brawl. "We were a pretty united group before the brawl, so we didn't
need an artificial stimulus to unite us," Thomas said. "I'm not
going to give that the credit instead of the players' hard work and
what they've been able to do. They're better men than that, and
they don't need to be artificially stimulated to stay together." Collins' return allowed the Knicks to rest three-time All-Star
guard  Steve Francis , who was limited to just 46 minutes of playing
time over the previous three games because of tendinitis in his
right knee. "It ain't cool sitting on the sidelines wearing suits, but I
can't just keep dragging on with an injury that's not helping
myself or helping my team," Francis said. "I was trying to hold
off until one of the other guards came back, either Nate or Mardy.
So I'm definitely grateful that Mardy was able to come back
today." Chris Kaman  had 13 rebounds for the Clippers, who have won four
of their last five games following a six-game losing streak. The
victory was their fourth straight over New York and eighth in the
last 11 meetings. Eddy Curry  had 15 points for the Knicks, who are 0-8 against the
Clippers at Staples Center. Brand's 18-footer gave Los Angeles its biggest lead, 82-58, with
8:10 to play. The Knicks got as close as 84-74 when Collins drained
his third 3-pointer of the game to cap a 16-2 run with 3:38
remaining. Brand foiled the comeback with a dunk and a 17-footer
that gave the Clippers a 90-74 lead with 1:32 left. "We were 3-0 on the homestand and we're getting our swagger
back," Brand said. "There's no better time than now, going back
east for six games. "Since I've been here, this trip every year
has been kind of a make-or-break stretch for us to make the
playoffs." Game notes Sunday was the 52nd anniversary of the night the Knicks
shot a franchise record-low 23.5 percent from the field against the
Milwaukee Hawks at Providence, R.I. ... Both teams played their
final game with the NBA's much maligned new basketball, which will
follow the Edsel, the pet rock and the hula hoop into oblivion on
New Year's Day. The Knicks were 13-20 with it and the Clippers were
14-16. ... The Knicks finished December 7-9. They have not posted a
winning record in any month since December 2004 (9-7). Last
December they were 2-12.
