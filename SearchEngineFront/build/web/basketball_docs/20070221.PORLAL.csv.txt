LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Phil Jackson wasn't particularly concerned with his personal losing streak. He was far more frustrated by the way the Lakers are playing. Jarrett Jack  scored 30 points and the  Portland Trail Blazers  beat Los Angeles 112-108 Wednesday night to give the Lakers their sixth loss in a row and Jackson the longest losing streak of his coaching career. "I think we deserve it," Jackson said of the slump. "We had a little bad luck with our injury situation, but we have not outplayed people, played harder than people. We have made mistakes in situations, which I told them was a pattern to almost all our losses we can see starting to emerge. "We don't consistently defend and we don't consistently rebound. That situation prevents runs." Jackson's teams had lost as many as five consecutive games only two other times in his 16 seasons as an NBA head coach, in 1993-94 with Chicago and last season with the Lakers. He has won nine NBA championship rings, including three with Los Angeles. Kobe Bryant , who scored 25 points, put Jackson's string of losses in perspective, saying, "It's obviously uncharted territory." Jack went 7-of-8 from the free throw line in the final 2:32 after the Lakers cut an 11-point deficit to 100-96.  Zach Randolph  added 22 points and had nine rebounds for Portland. Reserve  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 18 points, and  Brandon Roy  had 16 points and seven assists. Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan was asked about the Trail Blazers' chances of making the playoffs. Portland (23-29) is 13th in the Western Conference. "Talking about it, we can't talk about it," he said. "We've got to do it, our actions have got to speak for us, and that was the message before the game." The Blazers beat Utah 103-100 Tuesday night in their first game back from the All-Star break. The Lakers were playing for the first time. "We knew the Lakers were going to come out aggressive because they needed a win," McMillan said. "We knew they'd had a number of days off and this was their first game back after that break. "A lot of times your rhythm, your timing, your conditioning is not there and we wanted to take advantage of that." Bryant, coming off his MVP performance in the All-Star game, scored nine points in the final 3:51, but it wasn't enough to bring the Lakers back from a nine-point deficit the Trail Blazers built while he was getting a breather. Bryant finished 8-of-22 from the floor and 9-of-11 from the line. Reserve  Maurice Evans  had 23 points for Los Angeles, and  Smush Parker  scored 18. The game was close almost all the way. Portland finally opened up a lead with a 10-2 spurt during a 2:57 span that began with 7:44 remaining and Bryant on the bench. Aldridge and Randolph each had four points during the burst, and Portland was up 98-89 by the time Bryant returned to the floor with 5:06 to play. Los Angeles led by as much as 69-63 midway through the third quarter, but was up just 80-78 by the end of the period. Game notes  The Lakers and Blazers were supposed to have the court to themselves at 6 p.m. local time for pregame shootarounds. But they had to wait an extra 16 minutes because the Lakers' Development team, the D-Fenders was completing a double-overtime, 136-132 victory against the Arkansas RimRockers. ... Jackson didn't sound very optimistic about the Lakers getting any new faces before Thursday's trade deadline, saying he spent a couple of hours earlier in the day with GM Mitch Kupchak. "Things are still happening, but I don't like the degree of momentum, don't see a lot of momentum that's going to create anything right now, to be honest," he said before the game.
