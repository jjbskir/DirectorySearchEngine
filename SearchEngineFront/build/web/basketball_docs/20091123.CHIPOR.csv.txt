   He missed just one of his eight shots from the field and added 12 rebounds. Portland coach  Nate McMillan  liked that Oden simply didn't settle for his favorite offensive move, the jump hook. "He's doing a good job of establishing deep position by being patient," McMillan said. The Blazers had five players score in double figures.  Brandon Roy  had 18 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, while  Andre Miller  scored 16 and  Rudy Fernandez  13. Luol Deng  scored 25 points and  John Salmons  added 22 for the Bulls. Portland's 122 points was a season high and the Trail Blazers outrebounded the Bulls 47-27. They held the league's leading rebounder  Joakim Noah  to just eight boards. "I definitely was trying to keep Noah off the glass. By doing that, I ended up getting some good put-backs myself," Oden said. Portland scored a season-high 66 points during the first half by dominating inside and getting to the free throw line. Four Blazers scored in double figures during the opening half, led by Aldridge's 17 points. Chicago made its first nine shots in the third quarter and cut its deficit to 80-75. But the Blazers closed the period on a 10-5 spurt to take a 10-point lead heading into the fourth before blowing the game open. "We have to find a way to polish the game off and finish," said Bulls guard  Derrick Rose , who scored 14 points. "It's very hard to rebound when you have someone like 6-foot-6, 6-7 boxing out 7-footers. We have to find a way to get rebounds and run."
