CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Quiet  Chris Bosh  is suddenly talking all over the court, and the  Toronto Raptors  hope the newfound motormouth will lead them on a playoff run. Bosh put up offensive numbers consistent with his All-Star season on Monday night: 32 points, eight rebounds and 13 of 16 free-throw shooting. But the striking scene in the Raptors' 104-100 win over the  Charlotte Bobcats  was the sight of Bosh yelling out instructions on defense, warning teammates of back screens and announcing double-teams. It's something Bosh, never one to light up a room with boisterous conversation, decided he must do. "Sometimes I catch myself being quiet, but then I have to pick it back up and start talking again," Bosh said. "I'm not a talker by nature. That's how I am naturally. So I know I have to step outside of myself because I really like winning." The Raptors need wins as they try to avoid slipping to seventh place in the Eastern Conference and a likely first-round playoff matchup with powerful Detroit. Their third win in four games kept them alone in sixth, a game ahead of idle Philadelphia. Bosh was the difference as Toronto avenged a 22-point loss to Charlotte on March 2 when the Bobcats held a 32-0 edge on second-chance points. Bosh didn't play in that game. With the Raptors' talkative big man clogging the middle, Charlotte managed only seven offensive rebounds as its three-game winning streak was snapped. "I thought  Rasho [Nesterovic]  and Chris, I could hear them talking on defense," Raptors coach  Sam Mitchell  said. "Rasho is rubbing off on Chris, as far as communicating in the back." Nesterovic added 14 points and 11 rebounds, while  Anthony Parker  scored 20 points and  T.J. Ford  added 15, including the clinching free throw with 1.9 seconds left. Jason Richardson  scored 18 of his 26 points in the first half for the Bobcats.  Gerald Wallace  scored 20 points and  Emeka Okafor  had 18 points and 12 rebounds. Charlotte's faint playoff hopes took a hit, thanks to 45-percent shooting against that noisy defense. "If you call out a cross screen, guys are always looking to see where screens are coming and there are no surprises," Bosh said. "They won't get stood up by a screen, that's how you get beat backdoor. "If you talk, that makes the offense hesitate, too. If you say you're coming to double, the guy is going to wait on you a little bit, and that kind of stalls them. There are advantages all the way around." The defense helped carry Toronto in a game of large momentum shifts. The Raptors made 17 straight shots in the first quarter, fell behind by 10 in the second, then pulled away in the second half against the Bobcats, who were playing only their second home game in more than three weeks. Richardson's 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left cut Toronto's lead to 103-100. Ford was fouled, and made the second of two free throws, ending Charlotte's chances. "I think it was just the backlash of the West Coast trip," said Wallace of Charlotte's first game following a 3-2 trip that included a win at the  Los Angeles Lakers . "Our legs just weren't in it tonight." The weary Bobcats, who had played 10 of their last 11 on the road, were no match for the energetic Bosh. He made 9 of 20 shots and added five assists in 46 minutes. It's what the Raptors need to break out of their doldrums following last season's division title. "He's huge," Richardson said. "He's their leader. He's their superstar. He does a lot of things and had a great game." Game notes  The Raptors shot 82 percent (18 of 22) in the first quarter. ... Wallace, who has sustained four concussions in four seasons, had no problems after taking a forearm to the throat and hitting his head on Okafor's knee during Saturday's game. "He's going to get bumped, he's going to get knocked," coach Sam Vincent said. "It's just how he plays." ... F  Jamario Moon  was back in Toronto's starting lineup after  Jason Kapono  went scoreless in his place Sunday. Moon scored 15 points and Kapono never got in the game.
