 They're not as hot as their Western Conference nemesis in Dallas, but the Spurs -- No. 1 in John Hollinger's  NBA Power Rankings  -- are on a roll of their own. Having won 10 in a row (to Dallas' 16), San Antonio has improved to 43-18 thanks mainly to its defense. The pre- and post-streak breakdowns:

 What makes the Spurs the Spurs? How about hitting four 3-point field goals in as many possessions in the closing stages of Tuesday night's game at Portland, turning a 92-85 deficit into a 99-94 victory, San Antonio's 10th in a row. It was the first time in more than two years than an NBA team turned a deficit into a victory by hitting four 3-pointers in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or of an overtime period. The last time that it happened, the Spurs were the victims: Tracy McGrady hit four three-pointers in the last 35 seconds of Houston's 81-80 victory on Dec. 9, 2004.

 Beno Udrih  started the flurry and Ginobili made back-to-back 3s to cut the lead to 92-91. After a Blazers turnover, Udrih knocked in another 3 with 1:07 left to give the Spurs their first lead since 1-0. Finley dropped in a 24-foot 3-pointer with 35.9 seconds left and Ginobili scored on a driving finger role to complete a 14-4 run. "It was awesome," Duncan said. "I loved watching it. Watching Manu do what he does was an incredible stretch to watch. Mike Fin has been playing unbelievable off the bench." Tony Parker  returned briefly for the Spurs after missing two games with a strained left hip. He started and played the first half, but sat after that. Portland shot 50 percent for the game and dominated on the glass, outrebounded San Antonio 41-34. The Blazers hit 12 of their first 17 shots --  Ime Udoka  made five of them -- and took an early 25-15 lead. San Antonio went on a 7-0 run, but  Sergio Rodriguez  hit a 3-pointer and Portland led 29-22 at the end of the first quarter. Portland went up by 11 on a layup and free throw by Magloire. Duncan had 14 in the first half, but Portland led 54-47 at halftime. In the third, the Blazers hit two quick shots, a jumper by Roy and a 3-pointer from Udoka, to increase their lead to 12 right out of the gate. Portland led 74-65 at the end of the third period, but Finley went to work bringing San Antonio back into it, scoring the Spurs' next seven points to get them within four. Rodriguez head-faked Duncan into the air and dropped in a jumper, and then fed  Travis Outlaw  for a nifty layup to make it 86-78. The tables turned quick. Ginobili broke free for a dunk, and after Aldridge scored for Portland, the Spurs' 3-point carnival began. "They played like champions down the stretch," Roy said. "I'm going to learn from this game. They picked it up in the fourth quarter. Coach said that's what champions do." San Antonio was coming off an 88-74 win over the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Monday night. With the win over Portland, the Spurs are 11-5 playing back-to-back nights. "Confidence grows as you win," Duncan said. "Every step we take, we believe in each other more and more." Game notes  Blazers C  Joel Przybilla  had successful arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday, the team announced. Przybilla won't return this season. ... Spurs G  Brent Barry  took an accidental elbow in the face from Aldridge in the third quarter that sent him to the floor and opened a nasty cut that required stitches. He didn't return. It's not the first time this season that's happened to Barry. He needed several stitches in his forehead after a collision with Sacramento's  Ronnie Price  in November. ... Udoka made his first six shots and finished with 13 points.
