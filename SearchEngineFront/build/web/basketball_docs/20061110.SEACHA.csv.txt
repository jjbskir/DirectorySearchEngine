CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) --  Adam Morrison 's debut as a starter turned
into a night of frustration. Ray Allen  scored 26 points and  Rashard Lewis  added 19 of his 21
in the second half to lead the  Seattle SuperSonics  to a 99-85
victory over the  Charlotte Bobcats  on Friday night, spoiling
Morrison's first NBA start. Morrison, the No. 3 pick in the draft, was just 3-of-12 against
the team from his home state as he started in place of the injured
 Raymond Felton . The former Gonzaga star missed all three of his
shots in the decisive third quarter, including a layup on a fast
break during Seattle's 9-2 run early in the period that put the
Sonics ahead to stay. He managed only nine points and one rebound and failed to get to
the free throw line. "Right now, I'm not doing my job," said Morrison, who is
shooting 35 percent on the season. "I'm getting good shots, good
looks, I'm just not performing right now. I'm letting my team down.
I'm not hitting my floaters. I'm not even hitting my layups." Lewis, who was 0-for-2 from the field in the first half, scored
11 points in the third quarter, when the Sonics outscored the
Bobcats 35-19 to erase a four-point deficit. Lewis said a halftime speech by coach Bob Hill fired him up. "He kind of jumped on my case a little bit," Lewis said. "The
game was pretty close, but he didn't like our attitude and our
facial expressions. "In the first half, every time I caught the ball they were
coming with a double team. In the second half, it didn't seem they
were coming as fast and I got a lot more shots." Chris Wilcox  had 12 points and 13 rebounds for Seattle, which
overcame 18 turnovers to win on the road for the first time in four
tries. Emeka Okafor  had 20 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks, while
 Brevin Knight  added 19 points for the Bobcats before he was
ejected. But Morrison never could get on track, missing a variety of long
and short jumpers and runners. Coach Bernie Bickerstaff kept him on
the bench for the first seven minutes of the final quarter. When he
finally sent him to the scorer's table, the crowd responded with a
sarcastic cheer. But Morrison's next made shot came in the final
minute as he failed to score in double figures for the first time. "I'm playing the majority of the minutes at the wing spot and I
can't seem to put the ball in the basket," Morrison said. "I had
three floaters that went in and out. It's not the ball, it's not
the basket, it's not the coach. It's me." Allen, who was 4-of-6 from 3-point range, thinks Morrison will
turn things around. "He can definitely play," Allen said. "He's just going to
learn as each game goes by. It's also tougher when you have to
guard somebody on the floor. It does take away from your offense." The Sonics, who won just 13 road games last season and were
coming off a last-second loss in Orlando on Wednesday, were never
threatened in the final quarter, building a 17-point lead. The Bobcats, who shot 40 percent, led by as many as six points
in the first half behind Okafor, who had his third double-double.
But the Bobcats, who lost their second straight, faded in the third
quarter once the Sonics got the ball to Lewis, who was 6-of-10 in
the second half. "The third quarter set basketball back 20 years," Bickerstaff
said. "It was putrid. It was just awful." Knight, who moved over to point guard to replace Felton, added
seven assists, but was ejected with 2:21 left after referee David
Guthrie hit him with consecutive technical fouls. "Every call made against our team, he made," Knight said of
Guthrie. "The other refs made good calls. Anything else that was
called, the bad calls, he made."  Game notes Seattle rookie center Mouhamed Sene was inactive for the
game and Hill indicated the first-round pick could be sent down to
the NBDL. "I'm fearful Mo is sliding the other way," Hill said.
Sene is 0-for-3 from the field in three games. Newly signed Andreas
Glyniadakis was active for the first time and did not score in two
minutes. ... With the NBA suspending assistant coach John-Blair
Bickerstaff two games Friday for driving while impaired, the
Bobcats were a short a man on the bench. "We just all pitch in.
He's still able to be with us at practice," Bernie Bickerstaff
said.
