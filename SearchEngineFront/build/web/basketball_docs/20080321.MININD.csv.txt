INDIANAPOLIS (AP) --  Danny Granger  and the  Indiana Pacers  aren't giving up on their playoff hopes without a fight. Granger scored 32 points to lead the Pacers past Minnesota 124-113 Friday night for their third straight victory. Indiana moved within 1 1/2 games of idle Atlanta for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Despite a sprained right wrist, an injury that kept him out of Wednesday's game against Charlotte, Granger played nearly 40 minutes and shot 11-of-23 from the field, including 6-of-8 from beyond the arc. "I usually play through nicks and bruises," he said. "If this was a playoff game, I would definitely be out there ... and these are like playoff games for us." Granger's teammates weren't surprised to see him play with pain. The third-year forward missed the only game of his NBA career because of injury on Wednesday. "He really gutted through it and helped us get the win tonight," Pacers forward  Troy Murphy  said. "We've come to expect that from him." Mike Dunleavy  had 25 points and seven assists, and Murphy added 22 points and 15 rebounds for the Pacers (28-41), who set a franchise record with 16 3-pointers made. "The 3-point shot is a big part of coach [Jim] O'Brien's offense, and when we're shooting it well, we're a very hard team to beat," Granger said. Timberwolves guard  Randy Foye  was impressed with Indiana's ability to hit 59 percent of its attempts from long range. "They were really hot," Foye said. "It seemed like no matter what we did, they always had an answer offensively." Rashad McCants  had 22 points, Foye scored 16 and  Kirk Snyder  15 for the Timberwolves (17-51), who were trying to win three straight games for the first time this season. "It was a tough loss," McCants said. "Coming in, we thought we had a chance to win, but we had a lot of problems defensively." Trailing by 20 points late in the third quarter, Minnesota cut the deficit to 96-88 following  Craig Smith 's two free throws with 10 minutes left in the game. Indiana answered with the next seven points, including Granger's 3-pointer, to open a 103-88 lead. Dunleavy helped seal the victory with a rare four-point play with 2:23 left, giving the Pacers a 120-103 advantage. "Coach told us we have to approach every game with a playoff intensity, and that's what we're trying to do," Granger said. "Every game could be the one that keeps us out of the playoffs or puts us in the playoffs." Indiana turned an early four-point deficit into a 35-27 lead following Murphy's 3-pointer late in the first quarter. Murphy had 10 points and six rebounds in the period. The Pacers used a 7-0 run midway through the second quarter to make it 52-36, and they took their biggest lead of the first half, 66-46, on Dunleavy's 3-pointer. With Indiana holding a 93-73 edge with 2 minutes left in the third quarter, the Timberwolves closed the period with the final nine points, including consecutive 3-pointers from McCants. "We had our moments on offense, but just couldn't put together enough stops," Foye said.
