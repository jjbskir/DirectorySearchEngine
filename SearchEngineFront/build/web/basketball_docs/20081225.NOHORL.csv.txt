ORLANDO, Fla. -- First, coach Stan Van Gundy praised the  Orlando Magic  after their latest win. Then, he criticized them for a lackluster second half. Hedo Turkoglu  scored 20 points to lead the Magic to an 88-68 win against the  New Orleans Hornets  on Thursday in a matchup of division leaders. "Our first half was our best offensive half of the year," Van Gundy said. "The second half was easily our worst."

 The Magic began the game on an 8-0 run and used a separate 13-0 run in the second quarter to blow the game open, never trailing on the way to their season-high sixth straight win overall and their eighth straight win at home. They improved to 4-0 all-time at home on Christmas Day.

 However, he said he understood how his team could build a 61-31 halftime lead, then shoot 23 percent in the second half. "When my wife wants me to do things around the house, I do just good enough of a job to not get yelled at," he said. "That's human nature." Dwight Howard  had 12 points and 15 rebounds in Southeast-leading Orlando's sixth-straight win.  Rashard Lewis  added 18 points and  Jameer Nelson  14. The Magic's only loss in their past 11 games was by one point at Phoenix on Dec. 12. David West  had 13 points for New Orleans.  Chris Paul  and  Devin Brown  each added 12. Paul, the NBA steals leader (3.7 average), saw the end of his league-record string of 108 games with at least one steal. "Half the time when I got a steal I didn't even know it," said Paul, who was unaware his streak ended until after the game. "It was going to end at some point so why not Christmas?" The Magic led by 31 points early in the third quarter. The Hornets did not get closer than 19 points the rest of the game. "You don't want to give the championship already, but they played well tonight," Paul said. "They got us." New Orleans came in off a 13-point home loss to the Lakers on Tuesday. With backup point guard  Antonio Daniels  still sidelined, Paul has had to play nearly all the minutes, including a 17-point, 10-assist performance in 46 minutes against Los Angeles. Paul and most of the starters came out early in the fourth quarter with the Magic up by 20 to rest for Friday's home game against Houston. Nelson said the Magic were worried more about keeping Paul from creating shots offensively. "He can pass and score," he said. "One of our big goals was to keep him out of the paint." With  Peja Stojakovic  also out for the fourth straight game with back spasms, the Hornets were weak up front, and the Magic took advantage. Lewis hit four of five shots, including both 3s, in the first quarter. Hornets center  Tyson Chandler  picked up two fouls in the first six minutes. "We have to understand that against some of the these you can come out and mess around a little bit, but against the Lakers, Orlando and the team we play tomorrow night you can't come out that way," Hornets coach  Byron Scott  said. "That's the bottom line." Howard had three blocks and was called for goaltending twice as Orlando built a lead that grew to 29-14 at the end of the first quarter. Paul had eight points to keep New Orleans in the game. Fueled by a pair of 3s by Nelson and six straight points by Howard, including a rousing putback dunk, Orlando went on a 22-4 run to take a 59-29 lead with a little more than two minutes left in the first half. Orlando shot 56 percent and made eight of 14 3-pointers in the first half to take a 61-31 lead. Paul had 12 points at halftime. The Hornets resorted to a Smite-a-Dwight strategy, fouling Howard nearly every time he touched the ball in the paint. Howard, who was shooting a career-low 57 percent from the line this season, made four of eight. "His energy was great, but he was frustrated because they were hammering him inside," Van Gundy said. "Last year we would have won a big game or two and then come back and a lose a game we believed we should win," Howard said. "So far we've been staying consistent. That's a great sign of maturity for a young team." Former starter  Mickael Pietrus , still playing with a split on his broken right thumb, continued to come off the bench for the Magic and finished with 11 points.  Keith Bogans , who started in his place, did not score. Game notes  The Hornets won their previous two road games. ...
