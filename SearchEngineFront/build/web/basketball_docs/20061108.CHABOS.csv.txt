BOSTON (AP) --  Paul Pierce  kept Boston in the game with his scoring, but it was his pass that allowed the Celtics to earn their first victory of the season. Delonte West  made a jumper at the overtime buzzer on a pass from Pierce to lift Boston over the  Charlotte Bobcats  110-108 Wednesday night. Elias Says Wally Szczerbiak and Paul Pierce had 35 points apiece as the Celtics posted their first victory of the season with a 110-108 overtime decision over the Bobcats. No pair of Celtics had each scored at least 35 points in a game since Kevin McHale (38) and Larry Bird (35) did it in an OT win over Cleveland on Jan. 16, 1987.

Pierce drove the lane with time winding down and kicked the ball to a wide-open West, who knocked down a 20-footer. "In past years I would have maybe taken a bad shot or tried to go through people," Pierce said. "Once I saw they collapsed on me, I needed to trust my teammates. That is what better players in this league do." Pierce and  Wally Szczerbiak  each scored 35 points and  Ryan Gomes  added his first career triple-double as the Celtics kept the Bobcats winless in Boston. Gomes had 10 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists for the Celtics. "I don't even think I had a triple-double at Providence, maybe in high school," Gomes said. Brevin Knight , who finished with 22 points, missed a jumper with 7.6 seconds left in overtime for the Bobcats, who are 0-5 in Boston. "When a great player makes the correct play, and another good player knocks down the shot, you tip your hat and move on," Knight said. Gerald Wallace  tied the game at 100 with 10.5 seconds left in regulation after  Sean May 's shot was blocked by  Theo Ratliff  and on his second rebound, Wallace laid it in. Pierce's 18-foot jumper as regulation time expired clanked off the side of the rim. Emeka Okafor  continued his strong comeback after playing in only 26 games last season with 28 points and a career-high 18 rebounds. "You can sing the whole song about how we fought, but we want the win," Okafor said. "We've done this enough times." Boston overcame 25 turnovers to avoid starting the season 0-4 for the first time since 1969-70. Pierce grabbed 13 rebounds, but had a Celtics' franchise-record 12 turnovers. Szczerbiak scored 20 points in the third quarter on 6-of-7 shooting, including four 3-pointers, as the Celtics outscored Charlotte 37-25 to take an 82-74 lead after three. He had 33 points in Boston's last game against Washington. Othella Harrington 's fallaway jumper capped a 13-5 run and tied the game for Charlotte at 87 with 5:16 remaining. Boston trailed 24-17 after the first quarter while shooting 7-of-23 from the field with eight turnovers. The last four games between the Celtics and Bobcats have been decided by three points or less.
