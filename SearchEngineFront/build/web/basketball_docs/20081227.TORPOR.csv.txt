PORTLAND, Ore. -- This time,  Brandon Roy  and the  Portland Trail Blazers  didn't need any late-game heroics to beat the  Toronto Raptors . Roy had 14 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter,  LaMarcus Aldridge  added 19 points and nine rebounds, and Portland beat the Raptors 102-89 Saturday night, sweeping the season series for the first time since 2002-03. Greg Oden  broke out of a slump with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while  Travis Outlaw  added 12 points for the Blazers. Chris Bosh  had 29 points and nine rebounds for Toronto, which had a two-game winning streak stopped.  Jermaine O'Neal  scored 17 points,  Andrea Bargnani  added 13, and  Jose Calderon  had 11 points and eight assists. The Raptors dropped to 4-11 in their last 15 games. The Blazers (19-12) are half a game behind Denver for the lead in the Northwest Division.  Steve Blake  hit the game-winning 3-pointer to lead Portland over Toronto 98-97 on Dec. 7. In this game, Roy, who was 14-of-19 from the field and had nine assists, took over for Portland, scoring 20 points in the second half and pushing the Blazers into the lead while the Raptors' outside shooting faltered. Roy had an answer for everything Toronto coach Jay Triano threw at him. "We tried different guys, we tried double-teaming him, and he threw it out," Triano said. "We ran and we blitzed him. We had two different guys on him any time there was a screen." The Raptors were 6-of-8 on 3-point attempts in the first half and led by as many as 11, but they were just 12-of-34 from the field in the second half, missing all seven 3-pointers in the third quarter as the Blazers surged ahead. Oden had struggled lately, averaging just 6.0 points and 4.4 rebounds in his last five games, and had frequently been in foul trouble. After Portland's Christmas loss to Dallas, coach  Nate McMillan  said lineup changes might be forthcoming if the Blazers' defense didn't improve, which led to speculation that Oden might lose his starting spot. But McMillan didn't bench his rookie 7-footer, instead sitting down with the 2007 No. 1 draft pick for one-on-one chat. "I told Greg, 'unwrap yourself, take the cover off and let people know who you are," McMillan said. "Tonight he just went out and played and had fun with it." Oden, who has nine double-doubles this season, asserted himself down low for eight points and three rebounds in the first six minutes. He battled with O'Neal, frequently taking the 12-year veteran to the hoop. Oden had just three fouls. "It's always good when you can play against somebody physical and I can hit him and he's gonna hit me back and not do all that flopping stuff," Oden said about O'Neal. Toronto led by eight at halftime, but Roy tied it at 65 with a pull-up jumper and Portland entered the final quarter with a two-point lead. Roy and Aldridge scored back-to-back to give the Blazers and 82-74 lead midway through the fourth, and Roy hit a 3 and 19-foot jumper to put Portland up by 13 with 4:34 left. "Obviously, a player like Brandon Roy, when he gets going, he's pretty hard to stop," said Toronto's  Jason Kapono . Game notes  The Raptors haven't won three in a row all season. ... Portland is 11-3 this season at the Rose Garden. ... Bosh was 11-of-11 from the free-throw line and had all but one of Toronto's free-throw attempts.
