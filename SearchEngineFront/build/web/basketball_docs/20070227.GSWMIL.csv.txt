 The  Bucks  don't have much going for them these days, but they have kept intact their distinction of having never shot below 30 percent from the floor in any game in their 39-season history. Milwaukee shot 54 percent from the floor in its 122-101 win over the Warriors on Tuesday, extending its streak to 3,142 games -- more than 500 games longer than Cal Ripken's consecutive-games-played streak!

"To win our last two games really helped our psyche, really helped our confidence out," Redd said. "A very balanced attack tonight. Everybody stepped up." Charlie Bell  added 20 points,  Mo Williams  had 16 and a season-high 13 assists.  Ruben Patterson  came off the bench for 19 points and  Andrew Bogut  had 13 and 14 rebounds to help Milwaukee win consecutive games for the first time since its six-game winning streak in December. "We're not mathematically out of it," Redd said of the Bucks' faint playoff hopes. "We're in the Eastern Conference and have the opportunity to make a move." The Warriors also had a scare when  Josh Powell  was hurt when he dove for a loose ball late in the game. He slid head first into the scorer's table with about a minute left. Powell finished the game and was helped to the locker room by teammates. Powell was flat on his back on the trainer's table with a towel over his eyes when reporters entered the locker room. He was being attended to by the Bucks' medical team before being immobilized on a stretcher and transported by ambulance to St. Luke's Hospital for x-rays and observation. He will stay overnight in Milwaukee according to Golden State spokesman Raymond Ridder. Powell scored 12 points, grabbed eight rebounds and had five assists. The Bucks are just (5-22) since the beginning of January, but finally snapped a season-high seven-game skid with a 109-90 victory over Philadelphia on Saturday. Redd, who missed 20 games with a left patellar tendon strain, played in his fifth game since returning from the injury. During his absence the Bucks went 3-17. Monta Ellis  scored 17 points and  Al Harrington  added 15.  Jason Richardson , who recently returned after missing 22 games with a broken bone in his right hand, had 12 points, seven assists and eight rebounds for the Warriors, who lost their fourth consecutive road game. The Bucks took control by outscoring Golden State 29-15 in the third quarter, sparked by three 3s from Redd and two from Bell. With Redd back, Williams has moved back to point guard. He found Redd and Bell in just the right spots as he finished with six assists in the third. "It's fun for me now," Williams said. "It takes a lot of pressure off me now. I can just play my game and pick my spots." Milwaukee led 91-68 going into the fourth quarter and the Warriors never challenged after that. "They had most everything going," Golden State coach Don Nelson said. "I thought they really played well, moved the ball, ran good stuff. They had their way with us." Redd was 11-for-19 from the floor before leaving with the Bucks comfortably ahead 95-72 with 9:55 left in the game. Bell and Redd hit 3-pointers and Bell converted a three-point play as the Bucks pushed their lead to 76-62 midway through the third quarter. Then Redd hit consecutive 3s and made a three-point play before Williams hit a jumper that gave Milwaukee a 91-68 lead at the end of the quarter. Sarunas Jasikevicius  hit a 3-pointer that got Golden State to 106-87 with 4:34 left to play, but they never got the lead below 19 points. "We've got to keep pushing and staying positive," Richardson said as the Warriors started a crucial five-game road trip with a loss. Golden State needs to win in order to keep its Western Conference playoff chances alive. "We've still got a chance," Richardson said. The only Warrior that didn't see action as coach Don Nelson cleared his bench in the fourth, was  Stephen Jackson  who is out with a fractured big toe. Redd and Patterson sparked the Bucks in the second quarter. Redd hit three 3-pointers, a basket and a technical while Patterson added 10 points as the Bucks erased the Warriors' early 12-point lead and led 62-53 at the half.
