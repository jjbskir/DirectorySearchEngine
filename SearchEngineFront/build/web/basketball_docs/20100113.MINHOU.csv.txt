"I'm just happy that after three hours, we were able to come out on top." Jefferson pulled down a franchise-record 26 rebounds and scored 26 points for the Timberwolves, playing the team's first ever three-overtime game. "We kept fighting and got back into the game," Jefferson said. "I'm really crushed. It took a lot out of us."

The Rockets led by five early the first extra period, but the Timberwolves rallied and went ahead 98-96 on Ellington's 3-pointer.

The Rockets seemed to have the victory in hand in the fourth quarter after Brooks' reverse layup with 46 seconds left put Houston up 87-82. Jefferson scored inside and Brooks and Landry missed free throws in the final 10 seconds, allowing Minnesota a chance to tie.
