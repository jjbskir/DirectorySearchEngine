 With  Andre Miller  joining them in the backcourt,  Brandon Roy  had 24 points,  Steve Blake  added 15 and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the  San Antonio Spurs  96-84 Friday night. "It was a change of pace, maybe something we need," Roy said. Richard Jefferson  had 19 points,  Manu Ginobili  had 17, and  Tim Duncan  added 14 points and eight rebounds, but San Antonio lost  Tony Parker  to a sprained ankle and couldn't overcome a lethargic first half, playing one night after a loss at Utah. The Spurs (2-3) haven't won on the road yet this season. In an effort to shake up the Blazers' stagnant offense, McMillan inserted Miller into the starting lineup, placing him in an expanded backcourt along with Blake and Roy.

 "I looked at the schedule," McMillan said. "With the schedule the next week or two I am going to stay with it and look at it. It was a good unit tonight." With 2:36 left in the first half, Parker appeared to come down awkwardly, called timeout and left the floor for the locker room. He did not return.

The Blazers bench accounted for 23 of Portland's first 41 points and keyed a late first quarter 13-2 run. Oden muscled past Duncan for a driving layup to put Portland up 62-47 with 6:56 left in the third quarter. Roy added a jumper to extend the lead to 17. But the Spurs put together an 13-3 run, with  Antonio McDyess  hitting a 20-footer to cut the lead to 69-62. San Antonio went on an 8-0 run, with Ginobili making four free throws, to get to 77-72. Shortly after, Jefferson scored to make it 80-77, but Blake answered with a 3-pointer and Oden converted two free throws for the Blazers. "We committed too many mistakes from the get-go," Ginobili said. "It's too bad. It shouldn't be happening. We've really got to step out and try to play 48 minutes."
