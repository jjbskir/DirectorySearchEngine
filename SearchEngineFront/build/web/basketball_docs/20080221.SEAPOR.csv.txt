PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) --  Brandon Roy  and the Trail Blazers found a way to fix their five-game losing streak: play the  Seattle SuperSonics . Roy had 19 points and a career-high 14 rebounds,  LaMarcus Aldridge  added 18 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks, and Portland ended its skid with a 92-88 win over Seattle on Thursday night. Kevin Durant  had 20 points to lead the Sonics, who will host Portland on Friday at Key Arena.  Earl Watson  added 15 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. Travis Outlaw  had 19 points for the Blazers, who improved to 20-8 at the Rose Garden this season and are 4 1/2 games out of the last playoff spot in the West. "We were scrapping and getting out after loose balls, Roy said. "It's great to get a win but we're not there yet." Nick Collison  scored on a tip-in to get Seattle within 89-86 with 30.4 seconds left. After Aldridge made one of two free throws for the Blazers, Damien Wilkens dunked on the other end with 7.7 seconds left. But  Jarrett Jack , who had 15 for Portland, sealed the win with two free throws. "Our guys played really hard and really well, but just not hard enough," Seattle coach P.J. Carlesimo said. Roy had missed practice Wednesday because of a viral chest infection and a minor ankle injury. He struggled against the Sonics, going 2 of 8 from the field in the second half and going scoreless in the fourth quarter. Collison had 13 points and 14 rebounds for the Sonics.  Jeff Green  added 13 points and nine rebounds. Steve Blake  hit a 3-pointer at 2:02 in the second quarter to put Portland up 47-39. Roy scored on a give-and-go with Jack to take the lead to double digits just before halftime. Durant hit a 3 and then converted a layup to make it 69-66. Green tied the game at 70 in the fourth on a jumper and put Seattle up 74-73 with two free throws. "It seemed like they just always had a little bit of a lead and we could never really take over," Collison said."Each time we needed a stop we couldn't get it."
