AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- The  Detroit Pistons  got the  Los Angeles Clippers  at the right time, and they knew it. Chris Webber  had 19 points and nine rebounds and the Pistons beat the short-handed Clippers 92-74 Monday night for their seventh straight victory.

 With a 92-74 loss to the Pistons on Monday, the Clippers are 2-21 (.087) in Detroit since the start of the 1983-84 season (the Clippers last in San Diego). That's the worst road record by one team against another among teams that have been in the NBA for that entire time. In fact, the Clippers also have the next two worst marks over the last 24 seasons: 6-49 (.109) in Portland and 6-43 (.122) in Utah. The lowest non-Clippers entry is the Warriors' 7-50 record in Phoenix.

 The Clippers staggered in for their last stop on a seven-game trip and fell to 8-19 on the road. They were missing  Elton Brand , who was a late scratch with back spasms. "We reminded our guys of all that this morning, before the game, during the game and after the game," Pistons coach Flip Saunders said. "We've been in that situation too -- it isn't easy to be at the end of a trip like that, especially without Elton." Saunders even got the weather he wanted -- a chilly, snowy day with a winter storm about to roll in. "The teams from the East go out west early in the season, and we literally get our heads beat in," Saunders said. "But it is even harder for the Western teams, because they come through here around the All-Star break, and they go from 75 degrees to 10-below, and all they want to do is sit in their hotel rooms all day. That's just how we like it." The Clippers, who haven't played a home game yet in February, went 2-5 on the marathon trip, and one of the victories came against the struggling  Boston Celtics . Los Angeles hosts Atlanta on Wednesday. "This is the longest trip of the year, and we wanted it to turn out better than it did," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "There were a couple games on the trip that we played against teams that we felt we could beat, but we didn't get the job done." Detroit, which has beaten the Clippers eight straight times, improved to 11-2 since Webber joined the starting lineup. "There was a period where Chris was just attacking the basket and making great plays,"  Tayshaun Prince  said. "We caught the Clippers on the back end of a long road trip, where we knew they couldn't sustain for 40 minutes and we took advantage of it." Richard Hamilton  scored 15 points and Prince added 14 for Detroit, which had all of its starters score in double figures. "They played team ball, and when you do that, you can wear a team down," Clippers guard  Cuttino Mobley  said. "Before we knew it, we were down 15 and they were keeping that lead." Mobley led Los Angeles with 17 points, and  Corey Maggette  added 15.  Chris Kaman  had 13 points and nine rebounds before fouling out midway through the fourth. The Pistons led 45-38 at the half, holding the Clippers to 34.2 percent shooting, and took over in the third quarter. Webber had eight points and Hamilton scored five as Detroit opened the second half with a 13-3 run. The Pistons led 71-56 after three.  Sam Cassell  started the fourth with a three-point play for the Clippers but Webber scored the next four points to put the game away. "Webber gives them another dimension because he creates easy baskets," Dunleavy said. "That was a good pick up for them, and they are playing very well." Game notes   Paul Davis , who went to high school a few minutes from the Palace, replaced Brand on the active roster. Davis scored two points in 12 minutes and had a career-high seven rebounds. ... Brand's status is day to day. ... Dunleavy picked up a third-quarter technical for arguing a call. ... The Clippers matched their lowest scoring output of the season, set Jan. 6 at Atlanta.
