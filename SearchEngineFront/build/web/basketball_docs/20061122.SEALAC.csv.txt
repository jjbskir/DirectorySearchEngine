LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The  Seattle SuperSonics  used their
irrepressible 1-2 punch to hand the  Los Angeles Clippers  their
first home loss of the season. Rashard Lewis  had 35 points and 13 rebounds and  Ray Allen  scored
12 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter for the Sonics, who never
led by more than 12 points and never trailed in a 95-85 victory on
Wednesday night. Elias Says Both Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis made 3-point field goals for the SuperSonics on Wednesday, as they've now done in each of Seattle's 13 games this season. That matches the longest start-of-season streak of its kind for any pair of teammates in NBA history. Gilbert Arenas and Antawn Jamison both had at least one 3-pointer is each of the Wizards' first 13 games in 2005-06.

Clippers guard  Cuttino Mobley  said. "But we're giving other teams
confidence. We didn't have that many turnovers, yet we didn't have
that many rebounds. They outrebounded us, and we're the bigger
team." Reserve forward  Tim Thomas  scored 15 points for the Clippers,
who won their first six games at Staples Center to set a franchise
record for the fastest start at home. They were the road team in
Tuesday's 105-101 loss to the Lakers. "We caught them on the back end of a back-to-back, so we had to
take advantage of them early," Allen said. "Even though they're
at home, we knew they played last night and we didn't, so we had
fresher legs." Elton Brand  had 16 rebounds and seven points, and  Chris Kaman 
had 14 rebounds and 12 points for the Clippers, who reduced
Seattle's lead to 75-72 on Brand's 15-footer with 8:13 left. But
Allen responded with a 3-pointer on Seattle's next possession,
triggering a 16-7 run that put the Sonics ahead 91-79 with 2:37
left. Lewis helped spark the spurt with eight points. "I thought they were a little bit slow on the double-team in
the post," Lewis said. "That gave me time to make my move and go
into my shot. I've been in the league long enough to know what I
have to do in order to help us win ballgames. "My shot really felt good for me tonight. At the same time, I
was watching their defense and they were coming when I made a move
or on the dribble, so I was able to beat the defense before they
got to me." Thomas, who had a 13-point third quarter, opened the second half
with a pair of 3s a minute apart to pull Los Angeles into a 49-all
tie. But the Sonics scored the next nine points and restored their
double-digit lead on Lewis' three-point play with 7:17 left in the
third quarter. "We weren't putting them in situations where they had to make
plays under duress," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "We were
getting outworked, and it was disappointing to see. Big shots by
Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis kept us at bay." Seattle used 16 points from Lewis and 10 from Allen to build a
49-43 halftime lead. The Clippers, who fell behind Philadelphia by
16 points in the first quarter last Saturday at Staples Center
before beating them in overtime, again found themselves playing
catch-up at home after Seattle opened the game with a 22-10 run
that included nine points by Lewis. "It seemed like he scored so easily," Seattle coach Bob Hill
said. "They were double-teaming him and fronting him. So he just
took his time, read the double teams when they did come, and took
the right shots. He played a great game." Neither team shot over 40 percent during the half, so there were
plenty of opportunities for rebounds. Brand had 10 and Kaman nine,
while  Nick Collison  grabbed nine of his 13 boards for Seattle in
his first 13 minutes on the floor. The only thing that kept Los
Angeles close at intermission was its ability to get to the free
throw line. The Clippers were 13-for-19, compared to Seattle's
7-for-8. One non-call particularly irked Hill, and it had nothing to do
with fouls. Allen missed a 22-footer with 4:27 left in the second
quarter and the ball was still touching the rim when  Corey Maggette 
grabbed it and triggered a fast break, leading to a 21-footer by
Maggette that cut Seattle's lead to 40-36. Game notes The Clippers' loss left the  Utah Jazz  (6-0) and New Orleans
Hornets (4-0) as the only teams that are unbeaten at home. Three of
the Hornets' home games have taken place in Oklahoma City. ... The
Clippers, who finished 41 percent from the field, have shot below
50 percent from the field in every game. Last season they were 50
percent or better 21 times (17-4) and finished the campaign
shooting 46.5 percent. ... F  Danny Fortson , limited to just 6
minutes in Seattle's last seven games because of a sore right knee,
may be ready to play against Sacramento on Friday or San Antonio on
Sunday. ... Allen increased his career point total to 15,844,
passing Jack Twyman into 79th place all-time. Next on the list is
"Pistol" Pete Maravich at 15,948. ... No Clippers starter had
more than two field goals until Kaman's layup with 7:48 left in the
third quarter.
