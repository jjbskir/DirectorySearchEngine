EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The  New Jersey Nets  have long sought a productive backup for All-Star point guard  Jason Kidd . Elias Says Howard  Dwight Howard's remarkable stretch of field-goal accuracy continued on Saturday night against the Nets, when he shot 11-for-15 from the field and led the Magic with 25 points. Over his last four games Howard is 44-for-52 (.846), the third-highest field-goal percentage over a four game span for any player in NBA history (minimum: 50 FGA). Wilt Chamberlain owns the Gold and the Silver in that category; he was 44-for-50 (.880) and then 49-for-56 (.875) during two separate four-game spans in the 1966-67 season while playing for the Philadelphia 76ers.
 Read more  Elias Says . Marcus Williams  appears to have ended that search. Williams provided 12 clutch points off the bench and  Vince Carter  scored 32 points to lead the Nets to a 93-78 victory over the  Orlando Magic  on Saturday night. It was second strong game by Williams in as many nights. The rookie also had 17 points Friday in the Nets 92-78 win over the Celtics in Boston. "Marcus has some innate scoring ability," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "He gives us another guy who can not only make shots, but create shots. That's what good players do." Williams is finding a scoring groove. It was the eighth time in 11 games that he scored in double figures. "I think I have a lot more confidence now," Williams said. "Coach is letting me play through some of my mistakes and Jason is tutoring me, with all of the other veterans." Kidd had 10 points and nine rebounds as the Nets extended their winning streak to three. Dwight Howard  had another excellent shooting performance for the Magic, getting 25 points on 11-of-15 from the field along with 12 rebounds. It wasn't enough as Orlando lost for the 12th time in 16 games.  Darko Milicic  had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and  Jameer Nelson  had 14. Williams came in late in the third quarter to spell Kidd and immediately took charge by scoring the last six points for the Nets in the period as New Jersey took a 66-63 lead. Starting the fourth quarter, Williams orchestrated a 15-8 run that sealed it. Williams scored four points in the surge and dished out three assists. When  Antoine Wright  scored a fast-break basket with 7:29 left, the Nets had an 81-69 lead and were in full control. "Marcus Williams really hurt us," Magic coach Brian Hill said. "He came in the game and just seemed to have his way there for a little stretch. They scored 27 in the fourth quarter and the second unit was the group primarily responsible." Carter scored 17 points in the first quarter for New Jersey, which was tied with Orlando at 28 after one period. Carter shot 6-of-9 from the field, including 3-of-5 from 3-point range. The Nets' reserves scored the first 10 points of the second quarter and New Jersey took a 49-43 lead at the half. Rookie  Josh Boone , Williams' teammate at the University of Connecticut, paced the Nets in the quarter with seven points in only 6 minutes. The Magic clawed back in the third quarter, taking a 61-60 lead on a layup by Howard with 4:18 left. It was Orlando's first lead since Howard scored the first basket of the game. It went back and forth until Williams entered with 3:02 left in the quarter and the Nets took control. Game notes  The Nets played their 12th set of back-to-back games.

Nets F  Richard Jefferson  has progressed to a point of swimming as part of his rehabilitation. Jefferson, who underwent surgery Jan. 22 to remove "loose bodies" from his right ankle, was in the pool for the first time Saturday. There is no timetable for his return.
