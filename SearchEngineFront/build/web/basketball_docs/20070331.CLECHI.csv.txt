The three division winners are guaranteed spots in the top four playoff seeds, meaning the Bulls would be seeded fifth despite holding the third-best record in the conference.

"We want homecourt advantage, see if we can try to get it throughout the playoffs, if not, for the first and second round. We're in that position right now. We just got to continue to do the things we've been doing lately and win basketball games." After James' short jumper, the Bulls didn't get a shot off on the ensuing possession when Gordon was trapped and threw the ball away. "They were doing it the whole game," Gordon said.

Gordon missed a 3 with 1.9 seconds left. Hughes rebounded and was immediately fouled, making both free throws. "This is about as big as it gets for the regular season," Hinrich said.

Hinrich had 22 points and 11 assists and Deng finished with 12. "I can't fault our overall effort from a physical standpoint," Bulls coach Scott Skiles said.
