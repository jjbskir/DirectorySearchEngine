SEATTLE (AP) --  Ray Allen  hit deep 3-pointers, flat-footed
jumpers and scored on tough drives. He was also perfect from the
free-throw line. Allen scored a career-high 54 points to lead Seattle to a
122-114 overtime win over the  Utah Jazz  on Friday night, snapping
the SuperSonics' six-game losing streak. Allen's performance was second-best in franchise history to Fred
Brown's 58-point outburst against Golden State on March 23, 1974,
and easily surpassed Allen's previous career-high of 47 versus
Charlotte in 2002 while Allen was with Milwaukee. And Seattle needed every point on this night. "The circumstances -- us needing a win, going into overtime like
we did, being down in the fourth quarter -- it looked like we were
heading in that direction where we've been headed in many games up
to this point," Allen said. Allen was 17-for-32 from the field, 12-for-12 at the line and
grabbed 10 rebounds. He changed what was appearing to be Seattle's seventh
consecutive loss with a scoring burst in the closing minutes of
regulation that carried into the overtime. Allen scored 18 points
in the fourth quarter, 15 in the final 5 minutes. Seattle trailed
102-93 after  Mehmet Okur 's jumper with 2:32 left, before Allen
really went to work. "I'd say he was terrific," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "I
don't know if it can get any better." Allen started with a driving three-point play, followed by a
deep 3-pointer.  Chris Wilcox  added two free throws to pull Seattle
to 102-101. Carlos Boozer  -- who finished with 32 points and 16 rebounds --
scored at the rim, but Wilcox followed with a dunk, setting the
stage for the final seconds. Seattle fouled  Deron Williams , who made both free throws for a
106-103 Jazz lead. Allen then curled off a pair of screens and
swished a 27-footer with Boozer's hand in his face with 8 seconds
left, forcing the extra session. "Ray's performance was one of the finest most people here
tonight have ever seen," Seattle coach Bob Hill said. Allen opened overtime making a flat-footed 15-footer as the shot
clock ticked down. After  Andrei Kirilenko 's dunk,  Earl Watson 
scored underneath and Allen hit a 20-footer to give Seattle a
112-108 lead. Another jumper by Allen kept the Sonics' lead at four, but he
then had the ball stripped by Kirilenko, who passed to an open
Williams.  Andre Brown , recently signed to a 10-day contract from
Sioux Falls of the NBA Developmental League, hustled from behind to
block Williams' layup attempt. Nick Collison  then scored and Kirilenko missed two 3-pointers in
the final minute as KeyArena was energized for the first time in a
lackluster season. "Ray is a great player and great players need help too," Brown
said. "I made it my point to come off the bench and get the team a
spark." Utah tried a variety of defenders -- Kirilenko,  Derek Fisher ,
Gordon Giricek -- but none of them were able to slow Allen. It was
his first time scoring 40 or more since he had 42 at Phoenix last
season. "People want to know what the 'zone' is like, and if I could
have a tape and show people, this is what it's like," Allen said.
"You can't explain it. It just happens." Collison had his third straight double-double with 25 points and
13 rebounds. Watson finished with a career-high 16 assists, many of
them setting up Allen's jumpers. Okur found his shooting touch in the fourth quarter, hitting 4
of 5 shots, and finished with 23 overall. But Okur didn't attempt a
shot in overtime, while Kirilenko and Williams were a combined
1-for-7. Leading 84-81 midway through the fourth, the Jazz went on an 8-2
run, with four of the points provided by Seattle. Wilcox was called
for goaltending on Harpring's short jumper as he was fouled by
 Mickael Gelabale . Harpring completed the three-point play, then
Utah got an unconventional three-point possession 45 seconds later. Williams made the first of two free throws, but the second
bounced off the front of the rim. As Collison went to grab the
rebound, the ball bounced off his fingers and back through. Game notes Seattle C  Johan Petro  left in the fourth quarter with a
bruised right knee. ... Hill returned to the bench after missing
Wednesday's 107-103 loss to Miami with a respiratory infection.
Hill, who said he felt about 70 to 75 percent, said it was
"weird" watching Wednesday's game on television at home, but felt
the coaching staff did a solid job. ... Sloan said  C.J. Miles  being
sent to Idaho of the NBA Developmental League was simply to get the
19-year-old some more playing time. Miles started 12 games this
season, but had played in just one of the last five.
