SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Although they would prefer some easier victories, the  Utah Jazz  weren't going to complain about the one they pulled out Wednesday night. Carlos Boozer  had 32 points and 13 rebounds as the Jazz rallied from a 21-point third-quarter deficit to win their seventh straight game, beating the stunned  Sacramento Kings  110-101. Off to a franchise-best 11-1 record, the Jazz are getting accustomed to dramatic finishes. Their previous two victories required overcoming 16-point deficits in the third quarter, one of them an overtime victory over Phoenix. "We have some real fighters on this team, we keep getting down early but we come back in the second half," said  Matt Harpring , who had 16 points. "It was another great win, but we don't want to rely on winning this way." Trailing 84-71 entering the fourth, the Jazz owned a 39-17 edge in the quarter to snatch the victory away from the struggling Kings, who lost their third straight. A wide open  Mehmet Okur  took a pass from point guard  Deron Williams  and put Utah ahead for good with a 3-pointer for a 101-99 lead with 1:45 left. Boozer followed with a dunk and completed a three-point play to put the Jazz ahead by five with 1:02 to go. "They collapsed a little bit and he (Okur) was alone for about three seconds and was able to line it up, that was a big-time shot," Boozer said. "That was a heck of a game, coming back from 21 to win on the road." Williams had 20 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for the Jazz, who have the best record in the NBA.  Derek Fisher  had 16 points,  Ronnie Brewer  scored 11 and Okur added 10 points and 10 rebounds. Kevin Martin  had 24 points and eight rebounds and  Ron Artest  had 19 points for the Kings.  Ronnie Price  scored a career-high 16 points,  Mike Bibby  added 12 and  Shareef Abdur-Rahim  had 11. Utah finally got its offense going in the second half, continually getting the ball to Boozer, who used his big body to score inside and helped gradually carve into the Kings' lead. The Jazz finished with an NBA-high this season of 72 points in the paint. Utah outrebounded the Kings 48-34. "Obviously the rebounds tonight were a problem for us," Kings coach Eric Musselman said. "Williams played a great game for them and that's why they are 11-1. They are a great ballclub, down 21 to fight back on the road and win shows a lot of character." The Jazz entered leading the NBA in several offensive categories, but didn't play like it in the opening half when they shot 39 percent, committed 12 turnovers and trailed by 18 points. "They manhandled us all night, then all of a sudden things started to change," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "We had a good offense where we got the ball inside. In the second half we did a better job of executing, in the first half we were atrocious." Bibby fell to the floor on a defensive switch late in the second quarter, injuring his leg. He left the game, but returned to start the second half. He played only three minutes before leaving the game for good with a thigh contusion. "Mike took himself out because he was injured," Musselman said. "So we went with a shorter rotation and obviously as good as our defense was in the first half, it wasn't as good in the second." Subbing for Bibby, Price helped ignite the Kings in the third period. He threw down an acrobatic left-hand dunk over Boozer, and made the subsequent three-point play. Price hit a long 3-pointer the next time down the floor and connected on another at the third quarter buzzer for an 84-71 Kings lead. Hustling on defense and shooting well from the perimeter, the Kings humbled Utah in the opening half. Martin scored 13 points, while both Artest and Bibby had 12 as Sacramento led 55-37 at the break. Game notes  The Kings had 11 first-half assists, one game after recording a season-low 10 in a loss to San Antonio.  Gordan Giricek  had missed the previous six games with an Achilles' tendon injury. He shot 1-of-6 and scored two points in 16 minutes. Back spasms continue to bother Artest, who did not start the second half but later entered the game after getting locker room treatment during the second period. The Jazz are now 5-1 on the road.
