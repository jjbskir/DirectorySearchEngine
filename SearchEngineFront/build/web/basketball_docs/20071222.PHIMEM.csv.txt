MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) --  Andre Iguodala  heated up in a hurry, and the  Memphis Grizzlies  couldn't stop him when it mattered most. Iguodala made a 20-foot jumper as time expired to give the  Philadelphia 76ers  a 99-97 victory over Memphis on Saturday night. Iguodala, who had 17 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, converted the winner over  Mike Miller  from near the top of the key. By the time it went through the net, Iguodala and his teammates were already headed to the locker room after handing Memphis its ninth loss in the last 11. "[Miller] was on me pretty tight there," Iguodala said. "I took a hard dribble at him and got him to step back. That freed me up a little bit. It felt good coming off." Officials reviewed the basket before confirming the ruling on the floor that the shot came before the horn. "He just made a tough shot," Miller said. "You've got to give him credit." Memphis won its previous home game Wednesday night when  Rudy Gay  made a 3-pointer as time ran out to give the Grizzlies an 88-85 victory over San Antonio. Given Iguodala's shooting woes in the first three quarters, it would have been hard to forecast him making the winner. Iguodala missed 10 of his first 12 shots before getting untracked in the fourth quarter, when he went 7-for-9 from the field. "I had a few shots that felt really good, but they just didn't fall," he said. "That's the worst, when shots feel good, and they're not going down. You really don't want to change things up. The main thing [in the fourth] was to get to the basket and get some easy baskets. ... The basket gets a little bigger then." Andre Miller  led Philadelphia with a season-high 29 points, connecting on 10 of 18 shots.  Kyle Korver  scored 14. Pau Gasol  had 31 points and 13 rebounds for Memphis, including nine points in the final 1:18. His basket inside with 5.2 seconds left tied it at 97, set the stage for Iguodala's jumper. Gay and Miller had 19 points apiece for the Grizzlies. "I thought the whole game we were on our heels," Philadelphia coach Maurice Cheeks said. " ... The latter part of the third quarter we started chipping away and chipping away, and then in the fourth quarter, we got some more." Memphis held double-digit leads in both halves and led 74-69 after three but the Sixers opened the fourth quarter with 11 straight points. Iguodala scored seven points in the surge, and Memphis missed its first eight shots of the period. "It just strayed away from us," Gay said. "I guess we thought we had the game at the end." Memphis led by 11 in the first half before holding on for a 52-47 advantage at the break. Gasol, playing in his second game after missing four with a jammed big toe, scored 17 points in the half, connecting on 7-of-10 from the field. Miller added 12 for Memphis. The Sixers managed only 39.5 percent from the field, including 2-of-8 for Iguodala. They finished the night shooting 44 percent compared to 49 percent for the Grizzlies. Game notes  The game was the nightcap of a doubleheader at the FedExForum. Earlier Saturday, the second-ranked Memphis Tigers defeated Georgetown (No. 4 ESPN/USA, No. 5 AP) 85-71. ... Grizzlies coach Marc Iavaroni played three seasons for the 76ers. ... Philadelphia has two players with Memphis connections --  Rodney Carney  played collegiately for the Tigers, and  Thaddeus Young  played high school ball in Memphis before attending Georgia Tech. Carney got his first start of the season as Sixers G  Willie Green  sat out with an injury to his left hip area. ... Memphis is now 1-7 in games decided by three points or less. ... Andre Miller has scored 20-plus in four of the last five games. ... Sixers C  Samuel Dalembert  had 14 rebounds, and has led Philadelphia in rebounding in six of the last seven games.
