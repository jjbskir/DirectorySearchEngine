PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The All-Star break is coming at the worst possible time for the  Philadelphia 76ers . They would much rather keep playing. Andre Iguodala  had 29 points, eight rebounds and eight assists as the 76ers won their fifth straight and completed a perfect homestand before the All-Star break with a 102-88 victory over the  Memphis Grizzlies  on Wednesday night. "It's unfortunate that the All-Star break is coming now," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. "But it is here and we have to think about where we are and where we're trying to get to." Samuel Dalembert  added 16 points and 12 rebounds and  Andre Miller  had 14 points and 11 assists for the Sixers, who improved to 23-30. Philadelphia has also defeated Washington, Miami, the  Los Angeles Clippers  and Dallas on its home court since Feb. 5. The 76ers are in a three-way tie for seventh place in the Eastern Conference with New Jersey and Atlanta. "It puts us in position to compete for a spot," Iguodala said of the playoffs. "We need to get better and understand that we need to get better as a group." Hakim Warrick  and  Rudy Gay  scored 23 points each for the Grizzlies (14-38), who dropped their ninth straight road game. Memphis, in last place in the Southwest Division, fell to 4-20 on the road this season.  Kyle Lowry  contributed 15 points and  Mike Miller  had 13. "We're going through some tough times right now," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. The Sixers scored the first 11 points of the third quarter -- five by Iguodala -- for a commanding 66-45 advantage. Philadelphia went on to hit seven straight field goals en route to a 78-60 lead. Memphis eventually went on an 11-2 run, including eight points by Warrick, and got within 92-86 on a thunderous dunk by Warrick with 4:08 remaining. But Philadelphia responded with back-to-back baskets by Miller and Iguodala for a 96-86 advantage with 2:45 left. "Since we traded  Pau [Gasol] , it's a matter of everyone stepping up," Warrick said. "It isn't just one player who's going to fill his shoes. We all have to step up together and be determined. We can't afford any lapses." Lou Williams gave the Sixers a 55-45 halftime lead after he hit a 37-foot bank shot just before the buzzer sounded. Iguodala led the way for Philadelphia with 20 points on 9-of-12 shooting. "I got a good rhythm going and I got some good shots," Iguodala said. The Sixers opened the game with a 14-2 advantage and wound up shooting 55 percent from the field, including 5-of-8 from 3-point territory. Game notes  Iavaroni was honored at halftime as part of the 25th anniversary of the 1982-83 Sixers championship team. He was a starting forward on that team, the last to win a championship in Philadelphia. ... Grizzlies G  Aaron McKie  wasn't with the team for personal reasons.
