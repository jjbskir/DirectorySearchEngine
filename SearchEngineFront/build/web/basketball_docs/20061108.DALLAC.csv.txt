LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The frown on  Dallas Mavericks  owner Mark
Cuban's face said it all. The defending Western Conference
champions are still winless. Cuttino Mobley  scored 28 points and the  Los Angeles Clippers 
beat Dallas 103-85 Wednesday night. The Mavericks, who tied a club
record last season with 60 wins and came within two victories of
their first NBA championship, have opened a season 0-4 for the
first time in the franchise's 27-year history. Dallas is the first team since the 2001-02  Philadelphia 76ers  to
start out with four straight losses after going to the finals. "We're just not cohesive yet as a team and we're not hitting
our open shots," Cuban said in the quiet locker room. "We just
haven't gotten off to a good start, but there's 78 more games and
that's all that matters. You never like to lose, but I'm not
worried about this team." This is the first time Dallas has lost four straight games since
 Avery Johnson  succeeded Don Nelson as coach on March 19, 2005.
Johnson, the reigning NBA coach of the year, entered this season
76-24. "We are disappointed. It is a tough start for us," Johnson
said. "We aren't playing good defense for long stretches of the
game and we aren't playing good offense. We are just playing in
waves. We are playing 26 minutes of a 48-minute game, and that is
not very good basketball." Sam Cassell  had 21 points and nine assists for the Clippers, who
have won four straight after losing at Phoenix in their opener. Los
Angeles has won six of its last 12 games against Dallas after
losing 17 of the previous 19 meetings. Two of their three losses to
the Mavericks last season were decided by two-point margins. Jason Terry  led Dallas with 23 points.  Jerry Stackhouse  made his
first start of the season at small forward in place of  Josh Howard ,
who is expected to be sidelined at least two weeks because of a
sprained left ankle. Stackhouse scored 12 points in 37 minutes. Dirk Nowitzki  had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas. He was
kept on a short leash by the referees during the final 28 minutes
of play, thanks to a technical foul he got with 4:05 left in the
second quarter after complaining that Mobley fouled him while
stripping him of the ball. "I think we did an excellent job on Nowitzki," Cassell said.
"We crowded him, forced him to take quick shots and put a monkey
wrench in his rhythm." Down by as many as 14 late in the first quarter, the Clippers
went on a 17-7 run in the third to turn a seven-point halftime
deficit into a 60-57 advantage. They took their first lead, 57-56,
on a 10-foot jumper by Cassell with 7:48 left in the quarter and
never trailed again. "We did well on the defensive end and it helped our offense,"
Mobley said. "They came out in that first quarter bombing and
moving around. But in the second quarter, we played Clipper
basketball. We played together, got some deflections and got a lot
more in the second half. We made them take tough shots, then we
rebounded the ball and ran it." Mobley triggered a 12-4 run with a driving layup and 16-foot
bank shot, and  Elton Brand  capped it with four free throws to give
Los Angeles a 97-83 cushion with 1:54 remaining. Brand finished
with 13 points and 12 rebounds. "We've got so many offensive threats, so when it's your turn
you've got to heat up -- just like Cat did tonight," Brand said.
"Cat and  James Singleton  did a great job on Dirk Nowitzki when it
counted. We boxed out and rebounded, came out with some intensity
in the second half, and that really helped." Terry, who was ejected from Monday's game against Golden State
after getting a flagrant foul for clotheslining  Monta Ellis , helped
Dallas open a 30-17 lead late in the opening quarter. But the
Clippers rallied with an 8-0 run in the second quarter and Mobley
drained a 3-pointer from 33 feet away, narrowing the gap to 48-41
with 36 seconds left in the half. "We started out with our small guards on Mobley and Cassell,
and those guys like to post up regardless of who they're playing,"
Stackhouse said. "So I think they tried to go at those matchups
early and got themselves going. And then the basket seemed pretty
big for those guys tonight. We played a lot of 1-on-1 and didn't
really get the ball moving like we did in the first half, and it
caught up with us." Game notes Dallas and Denver (0-3) are the NBA's only winless teams.
