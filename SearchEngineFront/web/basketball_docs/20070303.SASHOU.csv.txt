HOUSTON --  Tim Duncan  knew right away it was going to be a good night. Duncan scored 26 points and the  San Antonio Spurs  beat the  Houston Rockets  97-74 on Saturday night for their season-high eighth straight victory. Duncan hit his first five shots and scored 15 points in the first quarter. He had eight in a 12-0 run that opened an 18-5 lead with 6:18 to go in the first quarter. "It feels good to hit your first few shots," Duncan said. "It makes the rest of the game go easy. My shot felt good the entire night." Duncan hit at least four of his trademark bank shots, soft floaters that look off at first before they glance off the glass and fall in. "It's what's going in now," he said. "I hope it keeps going in for a while." So do the Spurs. "When he starts like that, it gives him confidence and gives us confidence, too," guard  Manu Ginobili  said. "When he starts making those shots, it opens up the whole game for us. "We played great, especially defensively. It was a great overall game by everybody." The Spurs got 14 points from  Michael Finley  and 13 points and eight rebounds from  Francisco Elson  as they won in Houston for the fourth straight time. San Antonio played without All-Star guard  Tony Parker , who sat with a strained left hip. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich pointed to the fact the Rockets are playing without center  Yao Ming . "I thought we played good defense tonight," Popovich said. "We also were playing a team that is very undermanned. I think Yao was playing at an MVP pace before he got hurt." Tracy McGrady  had 21 points, all in the first half, as Houston lost for the fifth time in eight games. "For us to turn the ball over 10 times in the first quarter, that just says it all right there," McGrady said. "And Duncan got off to a great start to get those guys going and they never looked back." Coach Jeff Van Gundy had no excuses. "The breakdown was we got it put to us by a championship-caliber team playing championship-caliber basketball with championship poise and intensity," Van Gundy said. "We really only had two guys playing well. (Shane) Battier and McGrady played well. I thought other than that we didn't have anyone play particularly well." Duncan's eight points in the third quarter helped the Spurs maintain at least a 20-point advantage through most of the period. San Antonio led 81-59 entering the fourth and the lead reached as many as 29 in the final period. The Spurs opened up a 20-point lead midway through the second quarter as Finley, who didn't play the first period, scored seven quick points and Elson added a three-point play for a 46-26 advantage. McGrady scored 14 in the second quarter to pull the Rockets within 12. But Duncan had 18 at the half as San Antonio led 54-42. San Antonio hit 73.3 percent (11-of-15) to lead 30-15 after one.
