CHICAGO -- A sizable lead gone and the game slipping away,  Chris Bosh  reached up and helped the  Toronto Raptors  grab another victory. Bosh hit two free throws with 2.1 seconds left after he was fouled on an offensive rebound Tuesday night as the Raptors recovered after blowing a 12-point, fourth-quarter lead to beat the  Chicago Bulls  112-111. "This shows how this team has turned it around," Bosh said. "Despite the breakdown at the end, we stood strong and still got out of here with a victory." The victory was the 28th for Toronto, giving the Raptors one more win than all of last season. "We're a better basketball team. I think the record says that," Raptors coach  Sam Mitchell  said. "We have a lot of guys who can make plays." Bosh finished with 25 points and 14 rebounds for the Raptors, who ended a 15-game losing streak against the Bulls stretching back to Dec. 6, 2002. Andrea Bargnani  added 22 points for Toronto. In the closing seconds, Chicago's  Tyrus Thomas  blocked a layup attempt by  T.J. Ford  but Bosh rebounded and was fouled by Thomas before hitting both free throws. "Tyrus Thomas is a great leaper. He got a piece of it and I just came up and got the rebound," Bosh said. "I was talking to T.J. a couple of days ago and we were talking about game-winning free throws. He asked me if I think about it and I said, 'No, I just shoot.' He said, 'Think about it.' So, I thought about it." Ben Gordon , whose three-point play with 12.8 seconds left had given the Bulls a 111-110 lead and capped a 13-0 run, put up a jumper that was short at the buzzer. Gordon hit the floor but no foul was called on Ford who was guarding him. "Absolutely," Gordon said when asked if there was contact. "But we didn't get the call. I don't know why. I thought they got a lucky one at the other end. That's just how the game went." Bulls coach Scott Skiles had no complaints, even though there was contact. "A little bit, but not enough to call it there," Skiles said. The Raptors, winners of nine of their last 11, went ahead by eight points early in the fourth quarter when  Jose Calderon  converted a three-point play and moments later fed Bosh for a basket that made it 94-86. Finding holes in the Chicago defense, Calderon made three straight Toronto baskets to increase the margin to 12 with about 6 minutes remaining. Coming off a seven-game road trip and looking a step slow defensively at times, the Bulls got 30 points from  Luol Deng  and 26 from Gordon. Chris Duhon 's 3-pointer with 1:27 to go closed the deficit to five and after two Toronto misses, Duhon connected again from the corner, another 3-pointer that made it 110-108 with 35 seconds remaining. Bosh's pass went off  Anthony Parker 's hands and out of bounds with 21.1 seconds to go and the Bulls had a final chance. Gordon drove the lane and hit a bank shot as he was fouled, tying the game with 12.8 seconds left. His free throw gave the Bulls a short-lived lead. "We really didn't take control of the game like we should have in the first half," Gordon said. "To get so close and lose, I'm a little disappointed." Trailing by five points at the half, the Bulls caught up as Deng scored 12 points in the third with his jumper putting the Bulls up 73-70. But  Jorge Garbajosa 's third 3-pointer of the period and layup and then 3-pointer from Parker restored the Raptors' lead to five and they held on for an 87-82 advantage headed into the fourth. Bargnani was 6-for-7, including three 3-pointers, and also had a roaring dunk to score 17 first-half points -- 12 in the second quarter -- as Toronto took a 56-51 lead. The Raptors shot 60 percent in the first two quarters. Bosh had 12 first-quarter points and the Raptors surged to a 33-26 lead. Game notes  The Raptors' last win in the series before Tuesday night was 103-89 at Toronto on Dec. 6, 2002. ... A snowstorm coated roads, snarled traffic and made getting to the United Center a tough haul for some of the players.  Ben Wallace  and  P.J. Brown  didn't arrive until about 50 minutes before tipoff. ... Despite empty seats from the snow, the game was an announced sellout of 21,776.
