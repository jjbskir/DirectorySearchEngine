SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah's  Paul Millsap  isn't playing like a
rookie. The second-round draft pick looked more like a veteran Saturday
night, helping the Jazz match the best start in team history by
scoring six of his 18 points in overtime of a 120-117 victory over
the  Phoenix Suns . Millsap also had 10 rebounds for his first career double-double
as the Jazz rallied from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter. "I have a lot of confidence right now. I give thanks to my
coaches and teammates for that," Millsap said. "Coming in as a
rookie is hard, but I try to come in and do what I can." Deron Williams  had 25 points and 14 assists, and  Carlos Boozer 
added 22 points and 16 rebounds for the Jazz, whose only other 9-1
start was in 1999. The Jazz forced overtime on  Mehmet Okur 's three free throws that
tied it at 106, then Millsap took over in the OT. Millsap blocked
 Leandro Barbosa  -- swiping the ball out of the air instead of
knocking it out of bounds -- and also drove for a reverse layup
before fouling out. "It's amazing. You don't hear anything out of him, except what
he does on the court," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "He's not a
guy that runs out there and says 'I don't know what we're doing or
what's going on.' You just tell him and he does it." That's about the only sure way to please Sloan. Starting the
season 9-1 for the first time in eight years doesn't hurt, either.
Utah won at Seattle 118-109 on Friday, then found the energy to
rally at the end Saturday in front of the first sellout at the
Delta Center this season. "We're happy to be atop of the NBA in the standings now and
hope to keep that up," Williams said. "We picked it up got some
stops, got the crowd into it and the crowd was unbelievable tonight
and helped us get this win." The Suns led by as many as 16 in the fourth quarter. Shawn
Marion scored 35 points for the Suns, who played without point
guard  Steve Nash  for the second straight night because of back
spasms. The Suns fell to 3-6 and are 0-2 against Utah already this
season Phoenix had two chances to force a second overtime. Barbosa got
the rebound after  Marcus Banks  missed on a 3-pointer to tie it.
Barbosa got off a 25-footer just before the buzzer, but he also
missed and the game was over. "We had this game won. We played good for three quarters of the
game and to give it to (Utah) at the end is very frustrating,"
Marion said. "It's the same old, same old for us... We've got to
start learning from our mistakes." Okur finished with 18 points, two blocked shots and five
rebounds. The Jazz led 54-49, but the Suns outscored the Jazz 35-19 in the
third quarter behind the shooting of Marion. Marion was perfect
from the free throw line, hitting all 11 shots. Marion had help from former Jazz player  Raja Bell , who scored
20, and  Amare Stoudemire , who finished the game with 19 points. Game notes Okur played in his 189th consecutive game. ... The Jazz
