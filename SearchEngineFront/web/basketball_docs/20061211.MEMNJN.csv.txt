 Carter Vince Carter went 9 for 20 from behind the three-point line Monday, making him only the fourth player to hoist as many as 20 threes in a game. Damon Stoudamire had 21 in April 2005, Michael Adams had 20 in April 1991 and George McCloud had 20 in March 1996.

 "He could have shot with anything tonight," Grizzlies guard  Chucky Atkins  said. "He was shooting with golf balls, that's how big the rim was for him." Carter finished with 37 points, hitting his first five 3-pointers and 7-of-10 in the first half in tying the NBA season high for 3-pointers. The final two came in the third quarter during a run of four 3-pointers that helped New Jersey tie a franchise record with 15. "When you're hitting them like that and your teammates are trying to find you, after a while you get tired," said Carter, who tossed up 20 3-pointers in helping the Nets break a three-game losing streak and win for the third time in 11 games. "At least I'm in the record books for something." So is  Jason Kidd . The Nets point guard moved into sole possession of third place ahead of Wilt Chamberlain for career triple-doubles, registering his 79th with 12 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds. "I think Wilt, his name alone talks history," Kidd said. "It's huge. He changed the game of basketball. To be able to pass somebody who had an impact on the game, it's a great honor." Richard Jefferson  added 16 points for New Jersey, which rebounded after heartbreaking losses to Phoenix and Boston in their last two games. Atkins had 26 points to lead Memphis, which was never in the game after scoring a season-low 10 points in the first quarter and falling behind by 15 points.  Damon Stoudamire  added 14 points for the Grizzlies, who have lost three straight and eight of 11. Carter put the Grizzlies to sleep early. The All-Star guard, who was 14-of-30 from the field, outscored the Grizzlies 12-10 in the first quarter, hitting four 3-pointers. His four baskets matched Memphis' total for the quarter. The Grizzlies were 4-of-17 from the field. He tied his career high for 3-pointers with No. 8 with 6:39 left in the third quarter. No. 9 came 31 seconds later from the right wing, and it was followed quickly by 3-pointers by Kidd and Jefferson. "He's one of the best scorers in the NBA, probably one of the best in history," Jefferson said. "Tonight he got hot and we were trying to get him the ball any chance we could." Carter and Kidd held the old Nets' single-game mark with seven 3-pointers. Carter had eight in a game with Toronto. "They were hitting on all cylinders," Grizzlies guard  Dahntay Jones  said. "Jason Kidd was doing his job as the court general, and Vince and Richard Jefferson were hitting 3s. They could have beaten anyone in the league. They had it going tonight and we didn't."
