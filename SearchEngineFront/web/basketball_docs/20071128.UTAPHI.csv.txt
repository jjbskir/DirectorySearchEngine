PHILADELPHIA (AP) --  Carlos Boozer  is developing quite a reputation. Despite tweaking his right ankle before halftime, he had it re-taped and scored 12 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to lead the  Utah Jazz  to a 106-95 victory over the  Philadelphia 76ers  on Wednesday night. Ronnie Brewer  added 19 points and  Mehmet Okur  had 16.  Deron Williams  had 15 points and 15 assists for the Jazz (11-5), who rebounded after a 113-109 loss at New York two nights earlier. Boozer entered the game ranked fourth in the NBA in scoring (25.3) behind  LeBron James ,  Kobe Bryant  and  Tracy McGrady . Boozer was 12-for-17 from the field and it was only the fourth time this season that Boozer didn't register a double-double. "I think he's [Boozer] definitely an MVP candidate," Williams said of Boozer. "A lot of games he has put us on his back. He does everything well and he's tough." Boozer simply said his team needed him. "I told  Paul [Millsap] , 'I can't elevate so you get every rebound and I'll score," Boozer said. "I couldn't jump. I couldn't box out like I wanted to. I knew I could score." Boozer is 44-of-62 from the field (71 percent) over the past four games. "We're executing our offense," Boozer said. "Deron Williams is doing a great job of running the offense and getting us good shots on pick-and-rolls." The Jazz shot 55 percent from the field and finished with 32 assists on 39 made field goals. "We're a very confident team," Williams said. "When we execute, we'll get a lot of assists and convert easy baskets." Andre Iguodala  led the Sixers with 20 points while  Andre Miller  added 16. Lou Williams chipped in with 13 while  Willie Green  and  Samuel Dalembert  had 11 each. It was a frustrating night for the Sixers (4-10), who picked up a win at Milwaukee 114-99 on Tuesday. "We talked before the game about eliminating layups and they [Jazz] had 20-plus layups," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. "That's something I'm trying to stop." Utah surged ahead to a 14-point lead, 67-53, on a basket by Williams with 5:25 left in the third quarter. Philadelphia got within five, 89-84, on a driving layup by Williams with 6:46 remaining. But the 76ers could get no closer. The Jazz jumped out to a quick 13-2 lead, but the Sixers quickly rallied and the lead wound up changing hands six times in the first half. Utah shot 54 percent from the field and led 49-44 at halftime. Game notes  The Sixers haven't won consecutive games all season. ...
