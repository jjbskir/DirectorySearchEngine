INDIANAPOLIS --  Danny Granger  is making a habit of saving his best basketball for the second half. Granger scored 14 of his 18 points in the third quarter to help Indiana pull away, and the Pacers beat the  Toronto Raptors  102-84 Saturday night. The versatile forward, averaging 12.9 points, scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and overtime in Wednesday's comeback victory over the  Miami Heat . After starting 0-for-5 from the field against Miami, Granger scored four points on 2-of-4 shooting in the first half of Saturday's game. "I'm going to keep shooting regardless," he said. "If I miss four in a row and I'm open, I'm going to shoot it -- that's just the way I play." After falling behind 40-39 at the half, Granger and the Pacers began to take control in the third quarter. Granger made all four of his 3-point attempts in the period as Indiana opened a 69-61 edge. "He's just playing his game," said Raptors forward  Chris Bosh , who led Toronto with 26 points and 12 rebounds. "He's pretty much a 3-point threat now." Jermaine O'Neal  finished with 21 points, seven assists and six rebounds, and  Mike Dunleavy  added 15 points for the Pacers (23-20), who won their third straight game after losing a season-high four in a row. The Pacers are 3-1 with their new players on the court following an eight-player trade with Golden State on Jan. 17. Dunleavy,  Troy Murphy  and  Ike Diogu  have all made contributions. "The more games you play, the more comfortable you're going to feel," Dunleavy said. "Each and every game we'll get better, hopefully." O'Neal has been encouraged with Indiana's play since the trade. "We're starting to play well together," he said. "We have a fine mix of everything. If teams try to stack up on one thing, we come back with a different punch." The Pacers, who finished 11-of-22 from behind the arc, opened an 81-66 lead following consecutive 3-pointers by  Darrell Armstrong  and Dunleavy with 8 minutes left in the fourth quarter. "We wanted to force them to shoot the long jump shots, and they made them," Raptors coach  Sam Mitchell  said. Trailing 26-18 early in the second quarter, the Pacers went on a 10-1 run, which was capped by O'Neal's basket to give Indiana a 28-27 lead. The Raptors (22-23) took a 37-32 edge following Bosh's dunk with 3:30 left in the period. The Pacers scored the next seven points, but Toronto got a jumper from  Jorge Garbajosa  and Bosh's free throw to take a one-point halftime lead. "I think we ran out of gas a little bit," said Mitchell, whose team was playing a back-to-back after beating Boston on Friday night. "Those aren't excuses, but that's just the NBA." Game notes  In his first game after being named an All-Star starter, Bosh had 26 points and eight rebounds in the victory over Boston. ... Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy, whose team will play the Chicago Bears in the Super Bowl, attended the game. He received a standing ovation from the Conseco Fieldhouse crowd when shown on the big screen. ... The Pacers finished 3-1 on their longest homestand of the season thus far. They play at Detroit on Sunday. ... Indiana improved to 30-14 all-time against Toronto. ... Raptors rookie  Andrea Bargnani  had two points on 1-of-6 shooting from the field.
