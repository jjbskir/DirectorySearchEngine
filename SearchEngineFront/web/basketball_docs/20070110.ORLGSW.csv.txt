 Howard then hit two free throws in four tries over the final minute, much to the delight of  Keith Bogans . Howard had a career-high 30 points and a season-high 25 rebounds and the  Orlando Magic  won their fifth straight game, 91-76 over the  Golden State Warriors  on Wednesday night to snap a four-game road losing streak. "I was nervous," Howard said. "I'm just glad we got the win. ... I've been trying to push myself in practice to get every rebound, every block, trying to score every time and also getting my teammates involved -- and try to implement that in a game." Keyon Dooling  had two key 3-pointers during a 15-3 fourth-quarter run, including one with 9:06 left that gave the Magic a 73-61 lead in the opener of their four-game, seven-day road trip against the West. Dooling scored 11 of his 13 points in the final period and Bogans added 16 points off the bench. Baron Davis  had 13 points and eight assists but committed six turnovers after scoring a season-high 38 in the first meeting with the Magic on Dec. 22. "If I didn't have the ball in Baron's hands I was in trouble everywhere," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "We couldn't get anything done when he didn't have it and not much when he did." Howard, the league's top rebounder at 12.5 coming into the game, posted his fourth game this season with at least 20 points and 20 boards. He shot 11-for-18 and Orlando hit 40.5 percent of its shots to win for the 10th time in the last 15 meetings in the series. "Incredible," Dooling said of Howard. "Every game he's getting better and better. He's adding something to his game every single game." But the Magic lost forward  Trevor Ariza  46.8 seconds before halftime with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. His status for Friday's game in Los Angeles against the Lakers wasn't immediately known. Ariza, a third-year pro, scored five points, leaving him two away from reaching 1,000 for his career. Andris Biedrins  grabbed 15 rebounds for the Warriors and  Monta Ellis  had 14 points and four assists, but the Warriors gave up a Magic season-high 52 rebounds. "We just got frustrated and let that get to us," Davis said. "We turned the ball over too much and didn't give ourselves a good rhythm." Orlando used a 13-6 spurt to start the third quarter and take the lead after trailing 47-42 at halftime, and limited the Warriors to a season-low 10 points in the period. It was the 28th time this season the Magic have kept an opponent below 100 points. Golden State was held to a season-low in points. "Ten points, that was terrible," Golden State forward  Matt Barnes  said. "They beat us good, but a lot had to do with us. ... We've got to find a way to win. We're in a funk right now. This is a crucial part of our schedule." The Warriors returned home after sloppy performance Sunday in Phoenix, a 128-105 loss to the Suns in which Golden State committed 25 turnovers. The Warriors had 19 more Wednesday, facing a Magic squad that leads the NBA in turnovers, and lost for the third time in four games. They shot 50 percent in the first period but trailed 24-18 after the opening quarter in large part because of 10 turnovers. The Magic shot only 9-for-24 in the period. Golden State will have to be better Friday, when the Warriors host the defending NBA champion  Miami Heat . Adonal Foyle , whose role has greatly diminished under Nelson, played 17 minutes but had no points and only three rebounds to go with two assists, two blocks and a steal. Nelson said before the game he liked how Foyle played against the Magic the last time and wanted to give him another opportunity. Game notes   Grant Hill  played in his 600th career game. ...
