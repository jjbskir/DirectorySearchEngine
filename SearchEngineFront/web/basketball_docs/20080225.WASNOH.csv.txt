NEW ORLEANS (AP) --  DeShawn Stevenson  had never hit a game-winning shot in his six-year NBA career -- until Monday night. Stevenson drained a fadeaway 3-pointer as time expired to push the  Washington Wizards  past the  New Orleans Hornets  95-92. His buzzer beater capped Stevenson's already impressive performance as the Wizards guard scored a career-high 33 points to topple one of the Western Conference's best. "[The shot] felt good coming out of my hands," Stevenson said. "I was shooting it pretty good all night. Some went in, some went out, but I was happy that one went in." The Hornets led almost the entire game until Stevenson made two free throws with 14.4 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to give the Wizards a 92-91 lead. "DeShawn is playing through some ailments," Wizards coach Eddie Jordan said. "He was on the training table after the Cleveland game with doctors all around him. ... He just comes out every day. He's a warrior. He's a true warrior. "His confidence is growing. He's making 3s. He's a true pro." The Hornets'  Hilton Armstrong  missed two free throws with 7.3 seconds left in the game, but a lane violation by Jamison gave Armstrong a third chance. He hit the free throw to tie it at 92. Stevenson then raced the ball down the court to drain the winning shot right in front of the Washington bench as time expired. Stevenson scored seven of the Wizards' last nine points. "We've been playing great teams and right now, we've been playing it close, but we can't close," Stevenson said. "We kept it close, we kept going to Antawn. I kept getting some and-one calls, some easy buckets. I think as a whole we kept it together." Roger Mason  scored 12 points off the bench.  Brendan Haywood  also scored 12, while  Antawn Jamison  and  Antonio Daniels  each had 10. But Washington's players all pointed to Stevenson's performance as the reason behind the win. "Down the stretch, it was like DeShawn Stevenson versus the New Orleans Hornets," Haywood said. The loss extended the Hornets' losing streak to three and dropped them into fifth place in the Western Conference. "The only way you bounce back is to win," Hornets guard  Chris Paul  said. "We didn't get stops early in the second half and they scored. They got to the line and made shots and they hit a big shot to end the game." Paul led the Hornets with 22 points, along with eight assists.  Morris Peterson  scored more points Monday than he had in his previous four games combined, getting 18, with 11 coming in the first quarter.  David West  added 13 and  Peja Stojakovic  scored 11 despite shooting only 4-for-16 from the field. The Hornets led by as many as 15 when Stojakovic's 3-pointer put them up 50-35 with 2:33 remaining in the first half, but poor free-throw shooting and turnovers plagued them throughout. New Orleans coughed up the basketball 16 times and only shot 54.5 percent from the foul line going 12-for-22. "Between turnovers and free throws, I think they scored 47 points," Hornets coach Byron Scott said. "A lot of their points come off of our mistakes and fouls. I don't sense the urgency from our team on the things we have to do on the basketball court." Game notes  Washington F  Caron Butler  missed his ninth consecutive game with a strained left hip flexor and didn't make the trip. The Wizards are 9-34 without Butler in the lineup since the 2005-06 season. ... Hornets G  Jannero Pargo  hit a 3-pointer from halfcourt to end the third quarter. ... Jamison displayed a measure of good will by inviting 20 children from the New Orleans area to Monday's game. ... Attendance in the New Orleans Arena was 11,289.
