OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Maybe the  Atlanta Hawks  should adopt the  Golden State Warriors  fast-paced style. The defensive-minded Hawks, behind 27 points from  Joe Johnson  and a terrific game off the bench by  Salim Stoudamire , stopped a sixth-game losing streak with a 117-110 victory over the NBA's highest scoring team on Friday night. Stoudamire added 18 points,  Mike Bibby  and  Josh Smith  17 apiece and  Josh Childress  13 for the Hawks, who never trailed and won for only the second time on the road in 15 games. They also got 10 points and 14 rebounds from  Marvin Williams . The Hawks ended a seven-game road losing streak. They have two games left on a six-game road swing. Atlanta scored its highest total since a 116-11 win over Utah on Dec. 17. Golden State allows a league-high 108.1 points a game. "We got out and ran with those guys," said Johnson, who added eight rebounds and eight assists. "We made a lot of shots early so we were able to build a lead." The Hawks raced to a 35-23 lead after the first quarter, extended it to 23 early in the third and held off the Warriors, who got 35 points from  Baron Davis  and 24 by  Monta Ellis . Playing without starters  Andris Biedrins  (appendectomy) and  Stephen Jackson  (ankle), the Warriors got 14 points from  Kelenna Azubuike  and 12 from  Al Harrington  but had their four-game win streak stopped. They had won seven of their previous eight at home. "I have no excuses," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "It was a game I was worried about the whole day and rightly so. (The Hawks) are very athletic and very good and they deserve a lot of credit. I thought they played a great game." It was the first win in three games for Bibby, who was traded for four  Sacramento Kings  players last Saturday. With guards  Acie Law  [sprained right wrist] and  Speedy Claxton  [left knee] out with injury, the Hawks just needed Bibby to run the floor. Instead he broke loose with 13 points in the second quarter and he and Johnson combined for 32 by halftime. "It was a good win," Bibby said. "I am going to try and push these young guys as hard as I can and keep everybody on the same page and try to keep winning." He played sparingly in the second half with a sprained right foot and gave way to Stoudamire, who scored 12 points after halftime. "Salim was fantastic tonight," Atlanta head coach Mike Woodson said. "He gave us a huge lift, made big shots and held his own defensively. He's going to be right in our rotation." The Hawks (22-30) moved into a tie for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. "It was a great team effort," Woodson said. "I thought everybody played and contributed from the beginning to the end." Golden State (33-22) had a chance to move into the eight and last playoff spot in the Western Conference but remained ninth. Davis did his part, making 14 of 27 shots while adding seven assists and five rebounds. The Warriors were beaten 53-40 on the boards. "I didn't think that we came with a sense of urgency early," Davis said. "It's a tough deficit to come back from but we can't make excuses because two of our best players are out. We've got to go out and win." Game notes  After going for 21 points and 13 rebounds in a win over the Celtics Wednesday, Biedrins underwent a successful appendectomy Thursday night. The league-leader in field goal percentage (62.2 percent) is out indefinitely. ... Jackson, the Warriors' second-leading scorer at 20.6 per game, missed his second straight game. "When he walked in (the building) he looked good enough to play," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "But he said the ankle was just too sore."
