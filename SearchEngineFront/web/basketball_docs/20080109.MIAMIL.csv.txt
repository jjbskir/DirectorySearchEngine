MILWAUKEE (AP) --  Mo Williams  knew the  Milwaukee Bucks  would be without  Michael Redd  again, and he was well aware that the  Miami Heat  were trying to break a very long losing streak. So the guard simply played the entire game. Williams scored a season-high 35 points in 48 minutes to lead Milwaukee to a 98-92 victory over Miami on Wednesday night, sending the Heat to their ninth straight loss. "Mo can rest tomorrow," Milwaukee coach Larry Krystkowiak said. "I really liked what he was doing on the floor on both sides of the ball. Certainly scoring 35 points, he made some big plays for us. He's been a warrior with some of the injuries we've had." Dwyane Wade  scored 34 points to lead Miami, which extended its longest losing streak since dropping 12 in a row Nov. 8-Dec. 4, 2001, and also lost its eighth straight on the road. "It's frustrating, but we're not in here cussing each other out, pointing fingers at each other or nothing like that," Wade said. "We want to find a way to get out of it, and the only way we can do that is to continue to keep performing together. "You've got to take it. Just like I won a championship and never did that before, now I'm going through a losing streak I never did before. But what judges you is how you come back from it." Jason Williams  scored a season-high 23 points in his first game since recovering from inflammation in his left knee. "Dwyane Wade and Mo Williams pretty much canceled each other out," said Miami coach Pat Riley, who dismissed rumors before the game that this was his last year as coach. He also was asked after the game and left his press conference without an answer. Andrew Bogut  had 17 points and eight rebounds for Milwaukee, which played without Redd for the fourth game in a row because of a deep thigh bruise. "We're definitely more team orientated," Bogut said. "Nothing against Mike but sometimes we look for him too much and put too much pressure on him. I think now we're kind of moving the ball and different guys are stepping up on any given night. "We've been playing teams we should beat anyway. We've still got a long way to go. So we can't take these games in stride and think we're on top of the world. You've got to stay humble, I think." Mo Williams made all 12 free throws and added six assists for Milwaukee, which won its third straight game for the first time since winning five in a row Nov. 14-24. Williams made two free throws to give Milwaukee a 95-90 lead with 10.3 seconds left and has averaged 22.2 points and 6.0 assists over his last five games. "You saw [Miami] had fight," Mo Williams said. "I think Jason Williams and those guys, they came out with an extra boost. Those guys, I mean, we have a lot of pride in this league. I don't care who you are or how bad your team is. You want to win. When your pride is taken away at times, you're going to bring that everything-you've-got attitude. They showed it tonight." After a layup by Wade with 7.4 seconds left, Williams made two more free throws for a 97-92 lead with 6.1 seconds remaining. "He's played well against us," Riley said. "He's a very consistent player across the board. He has the ability to raise the level. He's not a selfish player. He had a hot hand and kept going for it." Ricky Davis  then missed a 3-pointer and  Yi Jianlian  made one free throw for the final margin. It looked as if Milwaukee would have an easier time after starting the fourth quarter on a 17-5 run.  Bobby Simmons ' basket gave the Bucks an 85-71 lead with 6:10 left. But Miami went on a 12-1 run, capped by two free throws by Jason Williams, to trim the deficit to 86-83 with 3:11 to play. Mo Williams answered with a 3-pointer for an 89-83 lead with 2:51 left. In the third quarter, Miami failed to score in the first 5:02, but later got a 16-2 run to take a 66-64 lead with 1:52 remaining. It was the team's first lead since 5-2. Game notes  The teams combined for just 11 baskets and nine turnovers in the third quarter. ... Milwaukee's  Jake Voskuhl  returned from a right hip strain injury. ... The Heat are 0-7 on Wednesdays and 4-13 when Wade scores at least 25 points. Milwaukee won at home for the first time since Dec. 22 against Charlotte, and 10 of its 15 victories are at the Bradley Center.
