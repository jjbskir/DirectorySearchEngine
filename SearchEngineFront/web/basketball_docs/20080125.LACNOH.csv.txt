NEW ORLEANS (AP) --  Peja Stojakovic  grunted as he got up slowly from in front of his locker, then smiled bashfully before uttering, "old bones." Stojakovic may have felt all of his 30 years after Friday night's game against the  Los Angeles Clippers  was over, but he shot like the All-Star he once was when the Hornets needed a lift. Stojakovic nailed five 3-pointers in a four-minute span in the third quarter, a surge that propelled the Hornets to a 111-92 triumph and their seventh straight victory overall.

 Peja Stojakovic  made five 3-point field goals in a span of 3:34 of the third quarter in New Orleans' win over the Clippers. Over the last five seasons only two other players made five 3-pointers in under four minutes:  Jason Kidd  in 3:09 on Feb. 27, 2007 and  Quentin Richardson  in 3:59 on Dec. 5, 2004.

"I don't know how to explain that," said Stojakovic, who finished with 6 3-pointers and 26 points. "You always think: 'You never know if you don't try.' You've got to let it fly. Some nights they go in, some nights not. Tonight, fortunately, they were good." The Hornets had squandered a 50-37 halftime lead and trailed 53-52 when Stojakovic went on his brief tear. By the time it was over, the Hornets had outscored Los Angeles 22-2 during a 4:07 span to take a 19-point led that they would not relinquish. New Orleans made 14 3s as a team, 12 in the second half, giving Los Angeles little hope of staging a comeback. "Making shots is contagious. It gives everybody on the floor confidence taking their shot once you see someone shoot the ball really well like Peja did," said  Rasual Butler , who followed Stojakovic's display with four 3s of his own for all of his 12 points. "It was definitely energizing. It was fun to watch. The bench was losing its mind. ... That's why he's Peja Stojakovic, one of the best shooters in the league." Jannero Pargo , who led the Hornets with 24 points in a victory over Portland two nights earlier, hit a pair of 3s and finished with 14 points.  David West  had 14 points and 11 rebounds, while  Tyson Chandler  had 11 points and 13 rebounds.  Chris Paul  added 14 assists for New Orleans (30-12), which has won 15 of 17 games to become the surprise leader in the powerful Western Conference. Corey Maggette  led Los Angeles with 24 points, while  Cuttino Mobley  added 20 and  Sam Cassell  16.  Chris Kaman  had 14 rebounds for the Clippers (13-26), who have lost two of three. The Clippers appeared primed to stage an upset when Maggette opened the second half with a 3-pointer and a three-point play on a layup as he was fouled. Maggette later added a fast-break layup during a 16-2 run that gave Los Angeles its brief second-half lead. Hornets coach Byron Scott called time-out and New Orleans returned firing away from long range. "Wow. We went up one point and it was bombs away," Cassell said. "The first shot Peja made, we couldn't play better defense. The next two, we couldn't play them any better. They went from one down to up 10 in the next few possessions." Mobley briefly halted the Hornets' momentum with a pair of 3s during an 8-0 Clippers run. The Hornets responded with a 7-0 run of their own, highlighted by Chandler's putback and another tip-in as he was fouled, giving New Orleans an 81-63 lead heading into the final quarter. Pargo added another 3 early in the fourth quarter and  Ryan Bowen , whose primary role is to play defense, hit two free throws and a pair of mid-range jumpers to put New Orleans up 90-73. Butler's 3-pointer, New Orleans' 10th, made it 93-75 with a little over six minutes remaining and the Clippers couldn't recover as New Orleans cruised to its 19th double-digit victory. The Hornets also outrebounded the Clippers 49-38, and Paul used his speed, exceptional dribbling ability and court sense to help turn numerous Clippers misses into 21 fast-break points the other way. "The long ball really crushed us," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "Stojakovic got away from us. Most of the game was even except for the differential in 3-point shots and fast-break points." Game notes  New Orleans is 18-0 when scoring 100 or more points, and 20-2 against teams with losing records. ... The Hornets, who play in San Antonio on Saturday night, wrapped up their homestand 5-0 and are 15-7 at home. ... New Orleans is 3-0 against the Clippers this season. ... The Clippers play Saturday night at Memphis before returning home to face Charlotte on Monday night. ... Attendance was 13,538.
