OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook  controlled the game, and his new backup helped out, too. Kevin Durant  scored 30 points, Westbrook had 22 and the  Oklahoma City Thunder  held off the  Charlotte Bobcats  98-91 on Saturday night. Nenad Krstic  added 13 points and 10 rebounds for the surprising Thunder, who improved to 15-14. They didn't earn their 15th win last season until the 60th game, on March 2. Point guard Westbrook had six assists and no turnovers in nearly 35 minutes. "He did a great job running the team," Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  said. "He gave us a lot of opportunities to score, he set our guys up for good shots. Thirty-five minutes with zero turnovers? I'll take that every night." Eric Maynor , recently acquired from Utah, keyed an early flurry and made all three shots in 13 minutes. "The guys welcomed me in, it's good that we've got two victories since I been here," Maynor said. "I'm just looking forward to continuing." A near-capacity crowd of 17,961 showed up at the 18,203-seat Ford Center, two nights after the biggest snowstorm (14 inches) in Oklahoma City history. Stephen Jackson  had 24 points for the Bobcats, who dropped to 1-13 on the road. "Score more points than our opponent," Charlotte coach Larry Brown said when asked what it will take to win on the road. "That is what all my coaches have always told me." Early in the second half Oklahoma City led by as many as 12 points, 62-50, after a 12-0 run. But Charlotte didn't go away, twice closing within four in the final 2 minutes. Beginning late in the first quarter, the Thunder built a 37-27 lead on the strength of a 17-0 run. Maynor, playing in his first home game since being acquired by the Thunder, led the scoring spree. He had seven of the final 10 points during that span, scoring after a steal, on a driving layup and with a 3-pointer. After Oklahoma City went ahead 39-29, Charlotte answered with a 12-0 run. But the Thunder led 53-50 at halftime. "You have to come in the game with the same confidence as you do at home, and you (can't) make mistakes because the home team already has the advantage," Jackson said.
