 "We played great and passed the ball," Charlotte coach Larry Brown said. "For three quarters, we probably played as well as we have all year. I don't think our bigs missed any shots." Gerald Wallace  finished with 22 points, connecting on 9 of 11 shots for Charlotte, which set a franchise record by making 66 percent of its shots. Memphis rookie  O.J. Mayo  scored only 7 points, ending his streak of double-figure games at 25. He spent the final 5:09 on the bench. "I wanted to give some guys some minutes," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "I just felt like we ought to have the best energy on the floor, so we took our regulars out." There wasn't much energy to be had from the Grizzlies -- Charlotte players continually went past them to the rim. "I think we just kept giving up," Memphis center  Marc Gasol  said. Rudy Gay  led Memphis with 17 points and  Darko Milicic  added 11. Charlotte coasted through the fourth on the way to consecutive victories for just the second time this season. The Bobcats' starting front line was a combined 31-of-40 from the field before taking a seat with about 10 minutes left. Charlotte outscored Memphis in the paint 70-42 and outrebouded the Grizzlies 41-23. Memphis' interior defense was ineffective from the start as the Bobcats scored 24 points in the paint during the first quarter. Okafor was getting inside for easy baskets and dunks. He had 16 points at the first break, missing only one of his first eight shots. Charlotte shot 76 percent in the quarter and finished the first half at 72 percent. No one missed more than two shots for Charlotte in the half. Augustin finished with 10 assists, part of a season-high 35 for Charlotte. "We're seeing what we can do when we spread the floor and share the ball," Wallace said. "You might have a good shot, but there may be one more guy that has a better shot." By the time Diaw scored on another dunk with 8:21 left in the third, the Bobcats were up by 24, the fans were booing, and Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni was looking for a timeout. At that point, Memphis seemed disinterested. Players were walking on the court, looking to each other when mistakes were made and still letting the Bobcats get to the basket. "It just wasn't our night," Grizzlies forward  Darrell Arthur  said.
