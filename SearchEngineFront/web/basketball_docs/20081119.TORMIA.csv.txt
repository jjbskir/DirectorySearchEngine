MIAMI --  Dwyane Wade  did something the NBA hadn't seen in more than 31 years. It still wasn't enough to take down the sharpshooting  Toronto Raptors . Andrea Bargnani  scored a season-high 25 points,  Jermaine O'Neal  added 16 points and 17 rebounds, and the Raptors were 8-for-8 on 3-pointers in the second half to overcome Wade's huge effort and beat the  Miami Heat  101-95 on Wednesday night. Wade finished with season highs of 40 points and 11 assists, plus added a career-best five blocks. Since blocks became an official stat, the only other player to have a 40-10-5 effort was Alvan Adams of the  Phoenix Suns , who had 47 points, 12 assists and five blocks against Buffalo on Feb. 22, 1977, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. "D-Wade was unbelievable tonight," Raptors coach  Sam Mitchell  said. "He made some tough shots." So did his club -- plenty of them, especially from long range.  Anthony Parker  went 5-for-5 in the second half on 3-pointers alone, scoring all 19 of his points after intermission, including a dagger with 47.5 seconds left to seal the win. "I had a good feel for the shots," Parker said. You think? Toronto went 6-for-6 from 3-point range in the third quarter, outscored Miami 13-2 during one stretch in that period and led 76-59 when Bargnani made three free throws -- he got fouled beyond the arc -- with 2:02 remaining in the period. On Miami's next defensive possession, Wade drew a flagrant foul for hitting Toronto's  Kris Humphries  in the face. It seemed over. Wade had other plans. "It got me kind of mad," Wade said. Wade scored Miami's last eight points of the third, getting the Heat to 77-67 entering the final 12 minutes, and he wasn't done. He had a dunk to open the fourth, then another with 8:43 left to give Miami its first lead since the early minutes, 84-83. Miami scored on seven straight possessions to open the final quarter, scoring a mindboggling 23 points in a 5-minute span, but it ultimately wasn't enough. "Well, we didn't like the result, but I think people probably got their money's worth on that game going down the stretch," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "That's about as electric as it can get." Wade's jumper with 1:02 left got the Heat within three, but Parker finished off his sizzling long-range night on the next possession, ensuring Toronto would get a split on its two-night swing through Florida. "Orlando got them when they were missing shots," Wade said. "And we got them when they weren't." Chris Bosh  added 15 points and 11 rebounds, as the Raptors beat Miami for the second time in four days.  Shawn Marion  added 20 points and 14 rebounds for Miami.  Daequan Cook  scored 10 points for the Heat. "You waste a lot of energy when you come back from 10 or more," said Wade, who has scored at least 30 points in five of his last nine outings. "You don't really want to do that." And the Heat had to do it twice. The Raptors ran out to a 17-6 lead, exploiting their size edge.  Michael Beasley , Cook and  Joel Anthony  all had two fouls by the end of the first quarter -- Beasley got his two in the first 72 seconds. And Anthony, Miami's best big-man defender off the bench, got his third against Bosh with 10:20 left in the half. Beasley's third came 1:53 later, when he tried to split two defenders as the shot clock ran down and got called for charging. Miami missed 11 straight shots in the first quarter, but found a way to hang around, trailing by only four at halftime and setting itself up for the big second-half run. "We knew they were going to make a run. Of what magnitude we didn't know," O'Neal said. "But we knew that if we stuck to our game plan, we would be OK." He was right. Even though Toronto was defended well on the 3-point tries in the second half, every one of them dropped, and Spoelstra and the Heat simply gave them credit afterward. "They only made nine? I would have sworn they made 99," Cook said. Game notes  Heat F  James Jones , the team's key offseason free-agent acquisition, had the cast removed from his injured right wrist this week and could be back in a month. Jones tore a tendon during the preseason. ... Anthony had his first assist in his last 339 minutes, dating back to last season, in the fourth quarter -- a neat bounce pass that set Marion up for a dunk. ... O'Neal has 12 double-doubles in 30 career games against Miami. His teams are 11-1 in those games.
