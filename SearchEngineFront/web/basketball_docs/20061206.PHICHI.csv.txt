CHICAGO (AP) --  Ben Gordon  started the first quarter onslaught with a 3-pointer, and in a flash he had 17 points. Just as quickly, the  Chicago Bulls  were on their way to 121-94 victory Wednesday night, and the  Philadelphia 76ers ' misery was deepening.

 The Bulls made 61.5 percent of their shots from the floor in a 121-94 romp over the 76ers. It was the 10th straight game in which Philadelphia posted a lower field-goal percentage than its opponent. That's the longest such streak for any NBA team this season and the longest for the Sixers in more than 30 years (since a 10-game streak in December 1974).

 Gordon scored 17 of his 31 points in a lopsided first-quarter, and the Bulls won their sixth straight. "We've really been doing a good job of hitting guys in spots where they can score the basketball," Gordon said. The Bulls hit 13-of-17 shots in the opening quarter to go ahead 39-16 and were 48-of-78 (61.5 percent) from the field in winning their sixth straight. They improved to .500 (9-9) and gained some payback against the Sixers. Philadelphia has dropped six straight and 12 of 14, and  Allen Iverson  made no effort to hide his disappointment. "We've lost 12 out of 14 games and obviously, something needs to be done," he said. "There needs to be a change. Somehow, something needs to be scrambled up. We need to figure out how to play a different way, because the way we're playing is not getting it done." The 121 points were a season-high for the Bulls, who have scored at least 100 in eight straight games. Gordon checked in midway through first quarter and wasted no time jumping on the Sixers. He hit 9-of-16 shots in the game, and he was 4-for-4 from the field with two 3-pointers and hit all seven free throws in the first quarter. He had 21 at halftime, and finished six points shy of his season-high. Luol Deng  wasn't bad, either. He scored 21 points on 9-of-11 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds. The Bulls have not lost since a 123-108 rout at Philadelphia on Nov. 24 in which Iverson scored a season-high 46 and  Chris Webber  did not play. "We were down, but it's the NBA; you get up the next day and you think about the next team," Deng said. "We did a good job of that. We've just been playing great." On Wednesday night Iverson scored 16 of his 25 points in the second quarter and spent the final quarter in the locker room with back spasms. Webber was a non-factor, with six points and six rebounds.  Samuel Dalembert  contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds, and  Kyle Korver  and  Andre Iguodala  added 13 apiece. "We've got to find a way we're going to play every single night," Iverson said. "We play different ways every night." And the Bulls certainly didn't play the way they played Nov. 24 at Philadelphia. If that game was their worst this season, then Wednesday's was their best. The Bulls left Philadelphia with a six-game losing streak and a 3-9 record, looking nothing like an Eastern Conference contender.  Ben Wallace  caused a stir the following night in New York when he was benched for violating team rules by wearing a headband. The Bulls won that game, and they haven't stopped. They hit six of their first eight shots and outscored Philadelphia 15-4 in the opening five minutes. And just as the Sixers appeared to be making a run, Gordon took over. With the lead down to 20-14, Chicago outscored Philadelphia 19-2 the rest of the quarter -- all but two of those points coming from Gordon. He hit his first shot -- a 3-pointer with just over four minutes left in the period -- and kept connecting. The 39 points were the most in a quarter for the Bulls this season, and the crowd gave them a partial standing ovation when it was over. The beating didn't stop, though. The Bulls were ahead 69-48 at halftime, their most prolific half since a 70-point outburst against New York on Feb. 20, 2002. They had not scored that many in a first half since Feb. 28, 1997, when they dumped 72 on Sacramento. Game notes  Nocioni had 14 points after undergoing an MRI on his sore right hip the previous day. He averaged 25 points the previous three games. ... Rookie  Tyrus Thomas  had a season-high 11 points. ... Wallace has suggested recently that he was trying to motivate the Bulls when he wore the headband in New York. Coach Scott Skiles' reaction? "I wish he would have told me that that night; I could have gotten some sleep."
