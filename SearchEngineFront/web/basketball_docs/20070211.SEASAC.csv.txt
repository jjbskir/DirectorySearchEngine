SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Ray Allen  has hit enough clutch shots in his career to recognize one as soon as he makes it. Allen scored 25 points and made a key 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter that helped the  Seattle SuperSonics  win their second straight road game following a franchise-record 15-game skid away from home, 114-103 over the  Sacramento Kings  on Sunday night. Sacramento cut a 22-point third-quarter deficit to two midway through the fourth quarter, but could never get over the hump. Allen's 3-pointer with 2:33 remaining gave the Sonics a 99-91 lead and they held on from there. "You can sense the daggers in the fourth quarter when you see the fans get out of their seats and walk to their cars," Allen said. "If you miss there and they go down and hit a two, that's a five-point swing." Seattle had snapped its long road skid with a 103-102 victory at Indiana last Wednesday. The Sonics lost at home to Sacramento on Saturday in between the two road wins. "Don't get too excited just yet," Allen said "We have a long way to go." Chris Wilcox  added 25 points on 8-for-9 shooting for the Sonics, while  Rashard Lewis  had 23 points and 10 rebounds and  Luke Ridnour  scored 14. Trailing by 15 after three quarters, the Kings tightened up defensively and scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter to cut it to 85-80. Seattle missed its first eight shots of the quarter and 10 straight overall before Allen's jumper made it 89-82 with 6:56 to go. John Salmons  then scored on the other end for Sacramento, drawing a foul from Wilcox. Salmons missed the free throw, but  Corliss Williamson  got the rebound to set up  Kevin Martin 's 3-pointer that made it 89-87, capping a 17-4 run. But that was as close as Sacramento would get. "It's good to win in someone else's house," Lewis said. "It got a little scary in the fourth quarter when Martin hit that 3. We knew Sacramento would make a run, we just didn't know when. We were able to withstand it and get the win." Martin scored 24 points to lead the Kings, who had won a season-high five consecutive games, including a 114-93 decision in Seattle on Saturday. Ron Artest  added 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Williamson had 20 points and 11 rebounds. "They took it to us in the first half," Williamson said. "In the second half, we did all we could to bring it back, but we couldn't get over the hump." Seattle made 37 of 41 free throws compared to 19 of 30 for Sacramento. "I thought the free throws were the difference in the game," Kings coach Eric Musselman said. "They converted theirs and we didn't convert ours. Other than that, the game was played pretty evenly." While both teams were playing the back end of consecutive nights, the Sonics showed more energy early, breaking out to a 16-point halftime lead and extending it even further in the third quarter. Seattle scored eight straight early in the third to take a 67-45 lead, prompting Musselman to call timeout and the normally supportive Arco Arena crowd to boo the home team. A night after shooting 39 percent, the Sonics were much sharper offensively. They made seven of their first nine shots and played a near-perfect opening half on offense. Seattle shot 55 percent from the field, made 14 of 15 free throws and turned the ball over only twice in the first half. "Last night, we got embarrassed at home and tonight we knew what we had to do to come out and win this game," Wilcox said. "So we came out and got on top of them early and tried to take the fight out of them." Wilcox was 6-for-6 from the field, made all three free throws and scored five of his 15 points during a 12-2 run late in the half that helped put Seattle up 59-43 at the break. Game notes  Lewis, who returned Saturday after missing 22 games with a torn tendon in his right hand, decided not to wear a protective glove on his hand. Lewis shot 2-for-11 with the glove Saturday, and 7-for-19 without it Sunday. "I was able to get a better grip on the ball," Lewis said. ... With C  Brad Miller  (left foot) and F  Kenny Thomas  (back) sidelined with injuries,  Justin Williams  made his first career start for Sacramento. He finished with no points and two rebounds in eight minutes. ... Sacramento had won five in a row against Seattle.
