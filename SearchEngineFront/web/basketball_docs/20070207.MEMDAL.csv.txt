 Nowitzki made all seven of his field goals in the opening quarter, including a 14-footer at the buzzer, to go along with 4-of-4 free throws, four rebounds, two assists and two steals. When he missed his first shot -- five minutes into the second quarter right after returning from an extended break -- the Mavericks had a 25-point lead. They needed almost all of that to overcome their own miserable stretches.

The others: Peja Stojakovic on Nov. 14 (7-for-7); Shawn Marion on Dec. 5 (7-for-7); and Grant Hill on Dec. 6 (7-for-7).   Elias Says 
 
 
 
 After trailing by as many as 27 before halftime, the Grizzlies got within 68-61 on  Mike Miller 's tip-in midway through the third quarter after Dallas missed its first 11 shots following halftime. Dallas led by 27 again early in the fourth before a 16-2 spurt by the Grizzlies. Memphis scored the first 12 points of the third quarter before Nowitzki made the second of his two free throws. But by the time Nowitzki made a 3-pointer at the end of the third, Dallas was back up 89-65. Nowitzki finished 14-of-20 with 10 rebounds and six assists.  Josh Howard  added 23 points and nine rebounds, and  Devean George  scored 15 points for the Mavs, whose last home loss was Dec. 7 against Detroit. They go for their 17th straight home victory Friday night against Houston. Pau Gasol  had 29 points and Miller 21 with five 3-pointers for Memphis, which lost for the sixth time in seven games and dropped to 3-21 on the road. Gasol had nine of the 22 Memphis turnovers. One season after the teams met in the first round of the playoffs, the Grizzlies (12-38) are 28 1/2 games behind Western Conference-leading Dallas (40-9), which has the NBA's best record. After sweeping that four-game playoff series last April, the Mavericks have swept this season's regular four-game set as well. A week earlier in Memphis, the Mavericks held on for a 95-94 victory despite a pair of 30-footers by Miller and  Chucky Atkins  in the final 5 seconds. Dallas had played only once since, winning 94-93 over Minnesota on Saturday night. Miller, who had 20 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter of the last meeting, started this one with another long 3-pointer. But that was the only time the Grizzlies led. Howard responded with a 3-pointer that started a 10-0 run for Dallas. The Mavericks led 40-24 after the first quarter, then scored 12 straight points after Gasol's 6-foot hook shot to start the second. After the Grizzlies got close in the third, they then had six turnovers in a five-minute stretch when George scored nine points for the Mavericks. Nowitzki hit consecutive baskets to end the quarter.
