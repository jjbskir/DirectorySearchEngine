TORONTO  --  Chris Bosh  has the  Toronto Raptors  right where they want to be -- in line for homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Bosh became Toronto's career leader in double-doubles when he had 13 points and 17 rebounds in a 96-83 victory Wednesday night that moved the Raptors ahead of the  Miami Heat  for third place in the Eastern Conference. If the season ended now, Toronto would play Miami and the first two games would be at the Air Canada Centre. "We want to get homecourt. It's great being division champions and getting the four seed, but at the end of the day you don't have that homecourt advantage," Bosh said. "With all the guys inexperienced in the playoffs, including me, I think we should try to kick it off at home." Anthony Parker  added 20 points for Raptors, who had six players score in double figures. Toronto ended a four-game losing streak to the Heat despite missing No. 1 pick  Andrea Bargnani  (appendectomy) and  Jorge Garbajosa  (left ankle surgery). Bosh has 111 double doubles, one more than  Antonio Davis . "I'm proud of it and I want to set the mark so nobody can get it," said Bosh, added that times have changed. "It's a new time of day here. We have a chance to do something that no other team has done here." Shaquille O'Neal  had 17 points and six rebounds for the Heat, who fell to 14-21 on the road. Miami plays four of its next five away from home. Toronto outrebounded Miami 53-35 and shot 46 percent compared to 41 percent for the Heat. O'Neal said they're taking too many jumpers. "Way too much," O'Neal said. "Our problem is we're all shooting and we just keep shooting instead of mixing it up and going to the hole. I don't have to tell them, we should know. The Spurs know it, the Mavericks know it, so we should know it." Toronto went on a 10-0 run early in the first quarter and never trailed after that. Toronto led 31-15 after the first quarter and 58-40 at halftime. Parker's 3-pointer and Bosh's dunk after a  Juan Dixon  miss gave Toronto a 65-46 lead with 9:16 left in the third. Bosh's alley-oop dunk made it 81-65 with 7:50 left in the fourth. Eddie Jones ' 3-pointer cut it to 11 with 3:47 left, but Dixon and Parker followed with jumpers. Miami played without Dwyane Wade (dislocated left shoulder) and  Jason Kapono  (ankle sprain). "We didn't get off a good start and a lot of it had to do with how good they are," Miami coach Pat Riley said. "It was a huge game for them and us." Game notes  Riley credited Toronto general manager Bryan Colangelo for turning around the Raptors. "Bryan Colangelo is one of the very best in the business. He's got great experience. Once they got him away from Phoenix I think that sent a message to the players that they were serious about things. He's made some great moves and  Sam Mitchell  has done a great job," Riley said. ... O'Neal played in Toronto for the first time since Jan. 26, 2005. He had been injured in every game since.
