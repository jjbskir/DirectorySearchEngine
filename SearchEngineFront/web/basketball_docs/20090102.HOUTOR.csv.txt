 Alston hinted at discord in Houston's locker room when asked whether the team is on the same page. "Not at all, not one bit," he said. "We had this happen the other night in Houston and it happened tonight. It's sad and it's unfortunate." Houston led by 15 against Milwaukee on Wednesday, then saw its lead cut to one before winning 85-81. Afterward, the Rockets said it didn't feel like a victory. For Toronto, Friday's win brought relief after a stretch that saw the Raptors drop 13 of 17, including four straight at home. "We needed that," Bosh said. "Everybody was thinking about the whole New Year thing and how to start off fresh, just get a change in momentum. That was a good win for us. We were overdue for it." Joey Graham  had 10 points, and  Anthony Parker  had eight points and eight rebounds in the Raptors' first home victory since a 101-88 victory over Indiana on Dec. 10. "We were gritty," Toronto coach Jay Triano said. "On every possession there was real focus." Toronto held Houston to a season low in points. The Rockets' previous low was Nov. 14 in a 77-75 loss at San Antonio. "I didn't like the way we played the whole game," Rockets coach Rick Adelman grumbled. "It just wasn't there, we weren't in synch. Everything was one-on-one isolation. There was very little movement." Reserve  Von Wafer  led Houston with 18 points.  Yao Ming  scored 14 points,  Ron Artest  added 12, and  Luis Scola  had eight points and 13 rebounds. Former Raptors star  Tracy McGrady , bothered by a sore left knee, was held to four points on 2-for-9 shooting. "I got a little frustrated at times," McGrady said. "It's kind of hard to get in the groove when you're only touching the ball once every five minutes." McGrady started but said he will skip Saturday's game at Atlanta and is only expected to play every other game during a stretch of three back-to-backs over the next nine days. Bosh scored six straight points as Toronto ended the first quarter with a 14-2 run to open a 25-14 lead. Houston cut it to 31-30 with 6:32 remaining in the second, but Bargnani scored eight straight points for the Raptors to build a 48-38 lead at the half. Bargnani opened the third quarter with five more points, part of a 9-2 run that gave Toronto a 57-40 advantage. "He's been playing well," Bosh said of Bargnani. "He's taken the challenge on defense and on offense. He's doing a good job." Houston shot 4-for-22 in the third, scoring only 10 points, and trailed 69-48 heading into the fourth. Already without forward  Jermaine O'Neal , who missed his second straight game with a sore right knee, Toronto lost guard  Jose Calderon  to a strained right hamstring early in the second quarter. "Nobody expected us to win tonight," Bosh said. "Not only did we win, we won in convincing fashion." Calderon, who came in third in the NBA with 9.0 assists per game, sustained the injury while driving to the basket late in the first. Calderon returned in the second but lasted just a few possessions before signaling to the bench for a substitution. He is day-to-day. For Calderon, who missed two November games with the same injury, it was the first time he failed to record an assist since a 102-98 win at Indiana last Feb. 25, a stretch of 57 games.
