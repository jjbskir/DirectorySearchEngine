MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The  Memphis Grizzlies  finally got fed up with being pushed around. Mike Miller  had 18 points and 13 rebounds, helping Memphis snap a four-game losing streak with a 98-80 victory over the Bobcats on Monday night. "All of us were sick and tired of being down and not being able to fight back," Memphis guard  Mike Conley  said. "We wanted to come back and get the lead, stay in the lead and keep moving from there." Juan Carlos Navarro  led Memphis with 21 points,  Hakim Warrick  scored 19 and  Darko Milicic  added 11 points and 10 rebounds. Derek Anderson  had a season-high 17 points for the Bobcats, and  Jared Dudley  scored 14. The Charlotte starters scored only 36 points in the game. "Guys didn't make shots. They got to the basket. You can pick any number of things," Anderson said. "Eleven offensive rebounds [for Memphis] in the first half. It's hard to beat anybody when you give them that many shots." The game turned early in the second half when Memphis, which had trailed by as many as 14, overtook the Bobcats and continued to stretch the lead. Some blamed the second-half collapse on playing the second night of a back-to-back. Charlotte lost 98-91 at Cleveland on Sunday. "I thought we ran out of gas," Bobcats coach Sam Vincent said. "We played pretty good for a half. We did some nice things in the first half. Our legs are gone, and our guys are tired." The Bobcats are vying for the last spot in the Eastern Division playoffs and were facing the lowly Grizzlies, who entered the night tied with Minnesota for the worst record in the Western Conference. The loss dropped the Bobcats five game below Atlanta, which holds the eighth playoff berth in the East. "It's a back-to-back. We didn't have any energy going into the second half, and they went on a run,"  Jason Richardson  said. "You can't come out flat even though we had a chance to win this game -- a very winnable game." Richardson could have been the example of Charlotte's bad night, but there were plenty of others who fit the bill. Richardson had eight points -- 13 below his average -- and  Gerald Wallace  scored 10 -- half of his average. The two were a combined 7-for-26 from the field, while  Raymond Felton  was 3-for-14, part of Charlotte shooting 41 percent. "When we got back, we took away the easy stuff," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "That is always a goal against this team. We were able to crowd them. "When we closed out, we did not let as many blow-bys occur as we did in the first four minutes," he said. The Grizzlies built the lead to double digits in the third period and then extended it to 16 in the fourth when Miller hit a 3-pointer and followed it with a spinning layup with just under seven minutes to play. Memphis eventually pushed its advantage to 21 points down the stretch and sent the Bobcats to their fourth straight loss. Charlotte missed all five of their shots outside the arc in the second half, while Memphis controlled the middle with a 56-32 advantage in the paint and outrebounded the Bobcats 49-42. Charlotte led 47-42 at the break. "In the first half, it didn't seem like we could make any shots," Miller said. "In the second half, we made some shots and got some stops." The Bobcats maintained the advantage through the half, building a 14-point lead while shooting better than 50 percent until the final two minutes of the half. That was when the Grizzlies started gaining confidence. Memphis came out with much more energy to start the second half and used a 17-6 run to overtake Charlotte and build its biggest lead at that point. Navarro fueled the run with consecutive 3s. Memphis was able to maintain the lead by outscoring Charlotte 30-17 in the period and carried a 72-64 lead into the fourth. "It's almost contagious," Conley said. "Once you see a couple of stops in a row, you start to feel good about yourself and have confidence, defensively, to stop a team from scoring." Game notes  The Bobcats were playing their fifth game of the season-high six-game road trip. The trek winds up Wednesday at Indiana. ... Milicic returned after missing Saturday's game at Golden State with a sore right foot. However, word didn't get to the public address announcer that Milicic was starting, and Warrick was announced before Iavaroni came to the scorer's table and made the switch. ... The Bobcats have only beaten Memphis once in franchise history, 105-87 on Jan. 19. Charlotte has never beaten the Grizzlies in Memphis.
