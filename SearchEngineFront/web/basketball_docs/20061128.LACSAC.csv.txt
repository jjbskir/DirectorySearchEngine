SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --  Tim Thomas  launched the last of the
 Los Angeles Clippers ' innumerable awful shots and headed downcourt
wearing a bemused grimace. The Clippers are bound to win on the road this season, and
they'll probably even win again in Sacramento at some point. It
just wasn't going to happen Tuesday night -- not while they put on
the worst shooting performance in the NBA this season. Ron Artest  had 28 points and eight rebounds in the Kings' 93-80
victory, their 14th consecutive win over their frustrated
California rivals. Mike Bibby  had 19 points and 10 assists for the Kings, who kept
the Clippers winless in six games on the road this season -- and
winless in their last 17 trips to Arco Arena since 1997. Brad
Miller contributed 12 points, eight rebounds and strong defense in
a reserve role in the Kings' third straight victory and the
Clippers' fifth consecutive loss. But the real story was the Clippers' 30.6 percent shooting --
worst in the league so far this season. "We just shot so horribly that it hurt us," said Corey
Maggette, who was a perfect 0-for-9. "We just have to bring the
groove back. We had good looks everywhere. The ball wouldn't stay
in." Shaun Livingston  scored a career-high 20 points and Cuttino
Mobley added 16 for the Clippers, but they couldn't carry their
erratic teammates, who were a combined 14-of-67. Elton Brand  had 13 points and 18 rebounds but went 4-for-15,
while Thomas went 4-for-18 and  Quinton Ross  was 1-of-7. The
Clippers missed 18 of their final 19 shots, falling behind for good
with just one field goal in the final 8:50. "I think I did a poor job," said Livingston, in his third NBA
season straight out of high school. "I only had four assists.
That's my job as a point guard -- to establish everybody else before
I establish myself." Sacramento steadily increased its lead in the fourth quarter
despite the first bad game of the season by leading scorer Kevin
Martin, who had just two points. Los Angeles couldn't score during
a 4 -minute stretch in the fourth as Sacramento produced nine
straight points, highlighted by Miller's key 3-pointer. "Our defense in the fourth quarter was phenomenal," Kings
coach Eric Musselman said. "When a team takes 18 more (shots) than
you do, and you win a game by 13 (points), that's a statistic that
stands out at you." Sam Cassell  was active but not in the lineup for the Clippers,
sitting out for the first time this season after spraining his
ankle in a loss at Denver on Sunday.  Chris Kaman  also missed his
third straight game with a sprained ankle. Even though the Clippers have become respectable in recent
seasons, they've remained confoundingly inept at Arco Arena, where
they haven't won since Nov. 7, 1997. The Kings' home winning streak in the series is the
fourth-longest active streak in the NBA, matching the Kings' home
streak against Memphis and trailing Sacramento's 19-game streak
against Denver. Earlier in the night, Denver's 17-game home winning
streak against Memphis was snapped. "It's one of those little streaks," said Miller, who played 27
minutes as a reserve in his second game back after missing eight
games with an injured left foot. "Some of us have been here for
all but one game in it. When you do well against a team, you kind
of take pride in keeping it going." Memphis and Toronto also won their first road games earlier in
the night, leaving Washington and the Clippers as the NBA's only
winless road teams. The Clippers scored 14 consecutive points in the third quarter
to erase a 10-point deficit. Livingston matched his previous career
high of 18 points on a layup late in the third, but the Kings took
a 70-67 lead into the fourth on a last-second alley-oop layup by
Martin -- his only basket of the game. "I'm going to watch this tape," said Martin, who was averaging
24.9 points. "I'm sure I won't make it all the way through, but
I'll learn from it." Game notes Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  is close to agreeing to a
contract extension. "We've been talking, and the talks are
seemingly positive, but I haven't signed the deal yet, so there's
nothing more I can really say," Dunleavy said. "Unless there's a
dramatic falloff, it looks like we're going to get it done." ...
Maggette went 6-for-7 at the free throw line. ... Bibby didn't make
a turnover in 39 minutes. Neither did Mobley in 35 minutes.
