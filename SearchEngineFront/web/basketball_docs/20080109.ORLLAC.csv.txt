LOS ANGELES (AP) --  Hedo Turkoglu  had his own personal cheering section Wednesday night at Staples Center. He put on quite a show for the fans from his native Turkey. Turkoglu scored 13 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and added three rebounds and four assists in the period, leading the  Orlando Magic  to a 113-106 victory over the  Los Angeles Clippers . Rashard Lewis  scored 20 points,  Dwight Howard  had 17 points and 17 rebounds and  Jameer Nelson  added 14 points and nine assists for the Magic (23-15), who won on the road for an NBA-leading 16th time -- one more road victory than they had all last season. Turkoglu finished with seven rebounds and seven assists to go with his 28 points, which matched a season-high. "It feels great, man. They just wanted to come and watch me," Turkoglu said of the contingent from Turkey that lives in the Los Angeles area. "I had a good game, too. It was a good present for them. I'm going to try and say hi to them, spend some time with them. "Hopefully this will get us back on track." The Magic had lost a season-high three straight games by a total of seven points including a 104-100 setback at Sacramento on Tuesday night. "He's had a lot of games like this," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said of Turkoglu. "We like putting the ball in his hands down the stretch. He makes solid, solid plays. Our guys can tell you, he's finished a lot of games like that this year." Corey Maggette  scored 27 points to equal his season high for the Clippers (10-22), who lost for the 10th time in 11 home games and for the ninth time in 10 games overall.  Tim Thomas  added 20 points,  Chris Kaman  had 17 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots, and  Cuttino Mobley  scored 16 for Los Angeles. The Clippers, who trailed by 18 points midway through the third quarter, outscored the Magic 13-2 to trim Orlando's lead to 99-98 with 4:15 remaining. Los Angeles had two chances to take its first lead, but Mobley missed a jumper and Maggette committed a turnover. "That was a big play," Maggette said of the pass he threw over  Brevin Knight 's head. "We had the momentum going as a team. It was a little too high." Regarding Turkoglu, Maggette said: "He just got hot, man. We took Dwight out of the game, Rashard kind of cooled down." Lewis then made a 3-pointer for Orlando's first points in nearly 5 1/2 minutes, giving the Magic a four-point lead, and Nelson's 3-pointer with 1:57 to play made it 105-100. A 3-pointer by Mobley and a free throw by Maggette cut Orlando's lead to 109-106 with 29.5 seconds left, but Turkoglu made two foul shots with 12.2 seconds remaining and Howard added two more with 6.2 seconds left to complete the scoring. "We kind of relaxed and let them back in the game," Howard said. "We struggle burying teams. It's tough right now -- we've been up and down. We're sticking together, things are going to turn around." Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  was ejected with 7:27 remaining in the third quarter after picking up two technical fouls in rapid succession. Assistant Jim Eyen filled in after Dunleavy headed to the locker room, slapping hands with a fans on the way. With Lewis and Nelson leading the way, the Magic outscored the Clippers 23-6 run for an 82-64 lead. Then, after Dunleavy left, Los Angeles went on a 15-6 run to draw within nine points entering the final period. "I thought our team fought and came back," Dunleavy said. "Unfortunately, we're going to look at the film tomorrow and be disappointed in some of the mistakes we made between some of our turnovers and shot selections." Maggette made a 3-pointer as the first quarter ended, and the Clippers scored the first nine points of the second period to cut Orlando's lead to 35-29. Los Angeles got as close as two points four times before the Magic extended their lead to 59-54 at halftime. Lewis scored five points during an 11-0 run that gave the Magic an 18-7 lead, and they were on top the rest of the way. Orlando led by as many as 18 points in the first quarter, shooting 15-of-21 in the period to 6-of-18 for the Clippers.
