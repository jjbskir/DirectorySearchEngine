CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Sean May  is determined to become a consistent outside shooter eventually. The plan moved into fast-forward on Wednesday. May had 20 points and 12 rebounds and hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 16 seconds left, leading the  Charlotte Bobcats  to a 111-108 victory over the  Sacramento Kings . The 6-foot-9 May, who had been 0-for-6 on 3s in his two-year career, hit both of his 3-point attempts. "A lot of guys don't expect me to shoot 3s," May said. "As you can see, last year I started shooting 12 to 15 feet. Now, I'm moving it to 15 to 20. Hopefully I'll eventually move out beyond that arc in a consistent basis. "Tonight we were just fortunate that it went down and we got a huge win out of it," he said. Matt Carroll  added 22 points and  Raymond Felton  fought off flu-like symptoms to score 16, including two free throws with nine seconds left to put Charlotte ahead by 3. Felton also assisted on May's 3, and his former North Carolina teammate never hesitated giving May the ball. "He was open and he was hitting all game. Who else should I give it to?" Felton said. "He was right there and hitting jump shots all game. He had hit that 3 at the end of the shot clock earlier in the game, so I said, 'Why not? Go for it, big fella. Go for the kill.'" Kevin Martin  scored 26 points for the Kings but failed to hit the rim on a desperation 3-point attempt at the buzzer.  Ron Artest  added 21 points but ran into May and drew a charge with 10 seconds left with the Kings trailing by one. "It wasn't a charge, but referees for the most part give me a lot of calls," Artest said. "So I'm not going to argue." Sacramento shot 52 percent, but committed 18 turnovers and lost its fourth straight game as it fights for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. "It's not a problem. We've just lost four games," Artest said. "Dallas lost four in a row in the beginning of the season. We're going to be fine." The shorthanded Bobcats won their first game since part-owner  Michael Jordan  announced Bernie Bickerstaff would not return as coach next season. Leading rebounder  Emeka Okafor  (strained left calf) missed his ninth straight game and guard  Brevin Knight  was out with a groin injury. Leading scorer  Gerald Wallace  fouled out with 3:37 left, and center  Primoz Brezec  went out with a twisted ankle with 25 seconds to go, but Charlotte still won its second straight. And  Derek Anderson  said it means a lot to win for Bickerstaff. "Because you know when you first start off, this is not the most attractive job," Anderson said of the third-year expansion team. "But he's made it attractive for people to want to come in and coach us. Hats off to that guy. He's done a great job." Artest, in his third game back from a two-game absence following his arrest on suspicion of domestic violence, hit a 3-pointer with 30 seconds left to put Sacramento ahead, 107-104. But Artest hit only 1-of-2 free throws six seconds later. The Kings shot 60 percent in the first half in taking a 61-56 lead, with Martin and Artest combining for 29 points. Charlotte stayed in it by going 6-for-10 on 3-pointers in the half. The Kings lost forward  Kenny Thomas  to a jammed left big toe in the third quarter, and Charlotte rallied to take an 82-80 lead behind Felton's 11 points. Martin's 3 with 6:13 left gave the Kings a 96-91 lead, before Anderson and Carroll made 3s to get Charlotte within one with less than five minutes to go. "We haven't done a very good job all year of defending the 3-point shot," Kings coach Eric Musselman said. "Tonight it cost us the game." Game notes  The Kings remain the only NBA team not to have beaten the Bobcats in Charlotte. ... Bickerstaff will be busy over the next four days, scouting NCAA Tournament games Thursday in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Sunday in Chicago, in between Bobcats games on Friday and Saturday. "Not bad for a guy who was fired," said Bickerstaff, upset with some reports that said he was forced out as coach. Bickerstaff said it was a mutual decision between him and Jordan. ... Knight is afraid he'll need additional abdominal surgery at the end of the season.
