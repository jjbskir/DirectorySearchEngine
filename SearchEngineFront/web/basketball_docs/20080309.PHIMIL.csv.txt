MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Imagine if Philadelphia called a play or two for  Thaddeus Young . The rookie scored 22 points,  Samuel Dalembert  added 18 points and 10 rebounds, and the  Philadelphia 76ers  coasted to a 119-97 victory over the  Milwaukee Bucks  on Sunday. "He scored 20-plus points and we didn't run one play for him," said Philadelphia coach Maurice Cheeks, after his team improved to 12-3 since Feb. 5. "That's the way he plays. Thaddeus has been playing that way since we put him in there." Young was 8-of-11 from the floor and made all six free throws, helping Philadelphia shoot a season-high 60.3 percent. "Anybody can step up," Young said. "We're not ball hogs." Andre Miller  added 16 points and nine assists for Philadelphia, which played the first of five games in seven days. The 76ers' fourth straight win moved them within one-half game of idle Washington in the Eastern Conference. "I think our defense has been getting better than it has been," Cheeks said. "We try to create a lot of offense from our defense and we did that tonight, and the night before. That's one of the reasons for our surge." Charlie Villanueva  had 25 points and eight rebounds for Milwaukee, which lost for the fifth time in six games. "I think Philadelphia is one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now that a lot of people are not talking about," Villanueva said. Michael Redd  added 19 points and  Charlie Bell  had 15 off the bench. "We haven't had a clue against Philadelphia all year long," Redd said. The Bucks were without starting guard  Mo Williams , who missed his third straight game with an abdominal strain, and forward  Yi Jianlian , who also missed his third straight game with a sprained ankle. Both players are listed as day-to-day. Andrew Bogut , who averages 13.7 points and 9.3 rebounds, had just one point and two rebounds. Philadelphia already had a 14-point lead when it went on a 13-4 run, essentially locking up its season-best third straight road win while shutting down a high-scoring Bucks team that had managed at least 100 points in nine of the previous 10 games. After  Andre Iguodala  and  Reggie Evans  hit consecutive baskets, Iguodala added two free throws to cap the run and give Philadelphia a 109-86 lead with 3:33 left. Iguodala finished with 15 points, one of seven 76ers to score in double figures.  Louis Williams  scored 13 off the bench, Evans had 11 and  Willie Green  10. Young threw down an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Miller to give Philadelphia a 65-43 halftime lead. "We laid a big egg effort-wise," Milwaukee coach Larry Krystkowiak said. "It's demoralizing to have them shoot like that." A jumper by Villanueva and two free throws from  Desmond Mason  cut the margin to 88-74 at the end of the third quarter. But with just over four minutes left in the fourth, Krystkowiak went to his reserves. He even called a timeout with 2.7 seconds left, which drew a few chuckles from the opponent. The coach knows his chances at a playoff run are getting slimmer with each loss. "We're not going to lose hope or give up and quit," Krystkowiak said. "It's not impossible, but it is getting improbable." Game notes  Milwaukee is 2-19 when its opponent shoots better than 50 percent. ... Bogut tied a season-high with seven assists. ...
