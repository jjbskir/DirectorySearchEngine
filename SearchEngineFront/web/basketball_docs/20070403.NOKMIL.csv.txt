MILWAUKEE --  Tyson Chandler  is doing whatever he can to help the New Orleans Hornets hang around in the Western Conference playoff race. Chandler had 18 points and 20 rebounds Tuesday night to lead the Hornets to a 119-101 victory over Milwaukee, the Bucks' seventh straight loss. It was Chandler's seventh double-double in the last eight games. Chandler also set the Hornets' single-season rebounding mark Tuesday with 901. The previous record was 898, set by Larry Johnson in the 1991-92 season. "We have a great opportunity" to make a playoff run, Chandler said. "When we get it going, we can be a pretty good team." The Hornets (34-40) moved within 2 1/2 games of the idle  Los Angeles Clippers  for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Hornets have not made the playoffs since the 2003-04 season. "We're understanding what we have to do and now it's just a matter of going out there and putting our minds to it," Hornets coach Byron Scott said. "I think we can make this thing very interesting." David West  led the Hornets with 24 points and  Desmond Mason  returned to Milwaukee to add 21. Mason was traded to New Orleans before the 2005-06 season after playing with the Bucks for two seasons.  Chris Paul  had eight points and 14 assists. The Hornets dominated the Bucks in the paint, outscoring them 56-34 and outrebounding them 47-25. For the game, the Hornets shot 54.5 percent from the field and made nine of 20 3-pointers. Milwaukee's 25 rebounds and only four offensive rebounds were season lows. "Tyson Chandler was a beast tonight," Bucks guard  Michael Redd  said. "Our frontline is so depleted. That definitely played to their advantage. We're all to blame for it because we have to do a better job of rebounding." The Bucks are without center  Andrew Bogut  and forward  Charlie Villanueva , who are out for the season with injuries. Redd said the free throw differential was also key to the Hornets' victory. The Hornets hit 26 of 31 free throws, compared to just 10 of 14 for the Bucks. "We have to stop settling for jump shots and get to the rim," he said. "We have to be more physical and attack. They did that and that's why they won the game." The Bucks (25-48) matched their longest losing streak of the season. Redd, who returned to the lineup after missing a loss Sunday to the  Washington Wizards  with a sore left knee, led Milwaukee with 27 points.  Lynn Greer  added a career-high 15 points. The Bucks, who led only briefly in the first quarter, closed the gap to 89-84 when  Dan Gadzuric  hit one of two free throws with 9:34 remaining. The Hornets then hit four 3-pointers in a row over the next 2:01, including one by  Bobby Jackson , who was fouled and made the free throw to complete the four-point play. After Gadzuric scored on a dunk, Chandler put away the game with a short hook and then a rebound and dunk to give the Hornets a 106-86 lead with 6:10 remaining. The Hornets went on a 16-5 run in the final 4 minutes of the first half to grab a 67-56 halftime lead when Mason hit two free throws with 4.7 seconds remaining. The Hornets shot 55 percent in the first half, outrebounded the Bucks 27-9 and hit 21 of 24 free throws. Milwaukee was 2-of-3 at the line in the half. Chandler had 14 points and 12 rebounds in the first half, while West and Mason each added 14 points. Redd led the Bucks with 16 points. Game notes  The game was a makeup for the contest between the teams originally scheduled to be played Jan. 13. However, that game was postponed after the Hornets could not travel to Milwaukee because of an ice storm in Oklahoma City. ...The Bucks will play the  Boston Celtics  on Wednesday night at the Bradley Center, the first time the Bucks have played back-to-back nights at home since April 13-14, 1999. ...The Bucks are 2-7 since Larry Krystkowiak took over as coach after Terry Stotts was fired.
