CHICAGO --  Derrick Rose  thought he capped off a spectacular fourth quarter with a game-winning layup, but instead had to take a secondary role as his teammates finished off the Trail Blazers in overtime. Rose scored 33 points and  Luol Deng  added seven of his 23 in the extra period to lead the  Chicago Bulls  to a 115-111 victory over Portland on Friday night. Rose scored 12 points in the fourth quarter, but was held scoreless in overtime when the Blazers started trapping him in the frontcourt. Rose thought he had it won with a layup over  LaMarcus Aldridge  as time expired to end regulation, but the ball rimmed out. "I thought it was definitely in after I hit the backboard. I said, 'It's in, that's game,'" Rose said. Brandon Roy 's jumper with 3:46 left in overtime gave the Blazers a 107-106 lead, but  Kirk Hinrich  answered for the Bulls with a driving layup, Deng made a fadeaway jumper, and  Joakim Noah  found  Taj Gibson  for a layup to put the Bulls up 112-107 with 2:09 remaining. "We had open shots. They were trying to double-team Derrick on the top. We found spots and moved the ball and had open shots," Deng said. Portland came back and Roy tried for the lead but missed a 3-pointer with 5 seconds left. Deng finished on the other end to seal the game for the Bulls with a dunk. The Bulls have won six of seven since the All-Star break. "We had stretches of good play and stretches of bad play but we were to take care of business in overtime," Hinrich said. Aldridge finished with a season-high 32 points and Roy added 23 for Portland. After missing seven games with plantar fasciitis, Noah has played sparingly in four games as he tries to return to full strength. When he was on the bench, the Blazers took advantage. Aldridge had 26 points through the first three quarters on 12-of-17 shooting, but Noah slowed down Aldridge late in the game with his defense. "We probably got a little greedy, but I asked him how he felt and he said he felt good, but I could see he got a little fatigued. His length made a big difference for us against [Marcus] Camby and Aldridge," Bulls coach  Vinny Del Negro  said. Noah finished with 11 rebounds in 27 minutes and slowed down Aldridge in the fourth quarter. The Bulls trailed 95-90 after Camby's dunk with 5:56 left in the fourth quarter, but they came back after Deng hit a jumper and made a pair of free throws. Rose then gave the Bulls a 96-95 lead with a layup. Roy's jumper over Deng in the lane tied it with 16 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Rose then missed a layup with Aldridge contesting as the buzzer sounded. "It was a lifetime [as the ball hung on the rim]," Aldridge said. "When he drove past me, I just tried to go and meet him at the rim. He kind of lofted it over my hand. It kind of made it tough on him to finish. It kind of hung on the rim and for a second I thought we lost then it came out." Aldridge was the second overall pick in the 2006 draft by the Bulls, but the Bulls turned around and traded him for the rights of Portland's fourth pick in that year's draft, which ended up being  Tyrus Thomas . The Bulls traded Thomas before last week's trade deadline to help clear cap space. "Last game I couldn't buy a bucket [4 for 12 in a win against Toronto]. I just tried to stay patient and tried to stay on my shot," said Aldridge, who also acknowledged Noah was a factor against him late in the game. "When he [Noah] picked up his intensity. I was kind of fatigued." Deng, who scored a season-high 31 points for the Bulls in Wednesday's win over Indiana, played despite a swollen left knee. The Bulls led 52-51 at the half.  Hakim Warrick  had 11 points off the bench in the first half for the Bulls. He finished with 15 points. Aldridge led the Blazers with 18 points in the first half. He was 8 for 10 from the field. Game notes  Camby was back in the Portland starting lineup after missing Wednesday's win at Toronto. He finished with 11 points and nine rebounds.
