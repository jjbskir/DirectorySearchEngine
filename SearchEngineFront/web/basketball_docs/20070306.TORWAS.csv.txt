The  Washington Wizards  beat the Raptors 129-109 Tuesday night by dominating the boards, accumulating a 33-10 advantage in second-chance points that essentially accounted for the margin of victory in a matchup of first-place teams. The Wizards finished with 49 rebounds to the Raptors' season-low 27, easily negating Toronto's 52 percent shooting. Bosh scored 25 points, but his one rebound was a season-low and well below his 10.3 average. "He had one rebound? Wow!" said Washington's  Gilbert Arenas , who scored 25 points and had his best shooting game in weeks. "Well, we were making shots. It's hard to get rebounds when you're making shots. He had one rebound, for real?" Yes, really. In fact, Toronto didn't score off an offensive rebound until  Kris Humphries ' dunk in the final minute of the first half. By then, the Wizards had built a double-digit lead they wouldn't relinquish. "Sometimes they just don't come your way," Bosh said. "And if you don't block out as a team, you can't rebound. Nobody can. I can say I'm going to go and get every rebound, but if I have to get a rebound on three guys, I'm sure they have the advantage." Antawn Jamison  also scored 25 points, and  Antonio Daniels  added 18 for the Wizards, who have won three straight since Jamison and  Caron Butler  both returned from injuries. Washington had lost twice this season to Toronto on the road, but now has a chance to gain a draw in the season series when the teams meet for the final time March 30. "From the beginning to the end, we had a real good air about us," said Washington coach Eddie Jordan, whose roster is the healthiest it has been this season. "A good personality about the game, a good attitude and approach, a chemistry, a togetherness, a comfort level. That's the first time we've seen that for 48 minutes." Arenas broke out of a slump by making nine of 13 field goals, including five 3-pointers -- his most 3s since Jan. 30. It was best shooting game overall since a 9-for-13 performance on Dec. 26. Arenas attributed the turnaround to a physical therapist who treated his sore shoulder late last week. "Ever since they popped my shoulder back in, my shot's been feeling good," he said. The Raptors entered the game as the NBA's second-worst rebounding team, and it's getting reflected on the scoreboard. The Wizards' 129 points topped the season-high Toronto allowed in its last game, a 120-97 loss at Cleveland on Saturday. "We didn't play with that fire, that intensity, that we've been playing with most of the season," guard  Morris Peterson  said. "We know the second half of the season teams are going to play more intense, and tonight we didn't match that intensity. We didn't bring the fight to them." Juan Dixon , who scored a season-high 24 points against the Cavaliers, was rewarded with his first start since he was traded from Portland to Toronto two weeks ago. He finished with 14 points. The first basket of the game was by Jamison after an offensive rebound, a tone-setter if there ever was one. In the first quarter, the Raptors' hot shooting was enough to offset their rebounding deficiency, but the Wizards began to pull away when Daniels had his best spurt of the season. Daniels went 6-for-6 in the second quarter, helping the Wizards to a 17-point lead. The score was 71-57 at the break, even though the Raptors were shooting 63 percent. "We're just not stopping anybody," Bosh said. "That's the main thing. Our offense is good; we shot 50 percent. It is what it is. It's about rebounds. It's about that defensive end." Game notes  Gilbertology update: Arenas said the game rated only a 6 on the "swag" meter, but he changed his mind after some prodding.
