PHILADELPHIA --  Andre Iguodala  and the  Philadelphia 76ers  did just enough to win. With the Sixers still stinging from a 31-point loss three nights earlier, that was just fine by them. Iguodala scored 16 points, including a late 3-pointer to give Philadelphia the lead, and knocked the ball away from  Terrence Williams ' hands before the Nets could attempt a tying shot to give the 76ers a 97-94 win over New Jersey on Friday night. "I wish we could have played better," Iguodala said. "We'll still take the win. It counts." Lou Williams  scored 18 points and  Jason Kapono  had 14 for Philadelphia, which rebounded from a 31-point loss to Boston three days earlier. Brook Lopez  led the Nets with 22 points and 11 rebounds while  Trenton Hassell  had 17 points and 12 rebounds. New Jersey fell to 0-6, the worst start in franchise history. The Nets were without six players due to injury and had only a four-man bench. "You go with what you got," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "It's not a sympathy league." After Lopez tied the game at 92 with a pair of free throws, Iguodala made a 3-pointer to put the 76ers up with 2:03 left. New Jersey lost guard  Courtney Lee  early in the third quarter with an apparent leg injury. The Nets were already missing guards  Keyon Dooling  (hip surgery),  Chris Douglas-Roberts  (flu), and  Devin Harris  (strained right groin); as well as forwards  Tony Battie  (right knee),  Yi Jianlian  (sprained right knee) and  Jarvis Hayes  (strained left hamstring). New Jersey built a 73-65 lead with 1:51 left in the third quarter and carried it into the fourth quarter. Williams's short jumper made it 87-81 with 7:54 remaining, but the Sixers came back with an 11-3 run to take a 92-90 lead with 2:54 left. Lopez then hit a pair of free throws to tie the game before Iguodala's 3 and the 76ers struggled briefly from the line to close out the Nets. Rafer Alston  made it 95-94 on a driving layup with 50.3 seconds left and  Thaddeus Young  made one of two free throws for Philadelphia with 21.8 seconds left. Eduardo Najera  missed a seven-foot bank shot in traffic and Iguodala hauled in the rebound for the Sixers. After being fouled, he also made one of two, but kept the Nets from attempting to tie the game when he knocked the ball from Williams' hand. "They were desperate," 76ers coach Eddie Jordan said. "When you play a desperate team that's very well-coached, it's going to be a battle. We found a way to win."
