AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Clank! The  Detroit Pistons  held Dallas to its worst game offensively this season and  Rasheed Wallace  backed up his talk with 21 points and nine rebounds in a 90-67 win Sunday. The Mavericks had their lowest scoring game while making a season-low 30 percent of their shots. Dallas missed 16 straight shots -- spanning 8 1/2 minutes in the first and second quarters -- leading to scoring a season-low 38 points and shooting a season-worst 29 percent in the first half. "We were active and switched more than we usually do," Pistons coach Flip Saunders said. "And, we threw a couple zones in." Dallas had a rough day at the other end of the court, too. Wallace said the Pistons had to take advantage of the undersized Mavericks by going inside, and he did. The bombastic center scored over  Dirk Nowitzki  on a fadeaway late in the third quarter as Detroit pulled away, and Wallace had more to say to the Mavericks. "He can't guard me!" Wallace screamed toward Dallas' bench. Saunders isn't sure anybody in the NBA can effectively defend Wallace under some conditions. "When Rasheed is ready, motivated and focused, he can dominate anyone he plays," Saunders said. "He's that good." The Pistons were on the other end of a 102-86 rout a month ago in Dallas. "They looked a little like the Mavericks the time we played them down in Dallas," coach  Avery Johnson  said. "They really wanted to even up the series, and they came out and took care of business." Nowitzki had 15 points on 3-of-18 shooting and 10 rebounds,  Josh Howard  scored 15 and reserve  Brandon Bass  added 14. The Mavericks struggled in part because they're missing two standouts, starting point guard  Devin Harris  (left ankle) and key reserve  Jerry Stackhouse  (right hamstring). "Forget about who we are missing," Johnson said. "We need the guys out there to play." Despite Dallas' awful start, Detroit led just 20-14 after the first quarter and 44-38 at halftime. While Wallace scored seven and Nowitzki was scoreless in the third, the Pistons took control by outscoring the Mavericks 22-13 in quarter. "Our goal is to always push for the first five minutes of the half and if we can, it seals the game," rookie  Rodney Stuckey  said. Tayshaun Prince  scored 16 and Hamilton scored all 10 of his points in the second half for the Pistons, who got solid contributions off the bench for the second straight game. Stuckey scored a career-high 11 and  Jarvis Hayes  had 10. The Pistons have won five straight. The Mavericks, who missed a chance to pull into a first-place tie with New Orleans in the Southwest Division, have lost two in a row after winning 12 of 14. "We didn't have too much of a rhythm on offense, and we've got to figure that out,"  Jason Terry  said. "We know what we are facing -- we're undermanned right now -- but we have to get things done." Game notes  Dallas' previous lows were 76 points on Dec. 12 at Toronto and 35-percent shooting on Nov. 10 at Portland. ... Stackhouse (right hamstring) is expected to return next week after showing progress in recent workouts and the Mavs hope Harris can soon remove the boot protecting his bruised left ankle. ...
