CLEVELAND (AP) -- With plastic ice bags strapped to both knees,
 LeBron James  leaned back in his recliner. As he peeked at the
flat-screen TV showing a game in progress, Cleveland's superstar
took a deep breath.

 Arenas The Cavaliers held Washington's Gilbert Arenas without a point until late in the third quarter (after he shot 0-for-5 from the floor during the first half). Over the past two seasons, Arenas played only one game in which he failed to score a point in the first half.

 It was an exhausting night. They always are against Washington. Six months later, James and the  Cleveland Cavaliers  still have
the Wizards' number. Larry Hughes  scored 27 points, James added 26 and Cleveland
opened a season its fans and players believe can end with an NBA
championship by beating the Wizards 97-94 on Wednesday night. In last season's playoffs, the Cavaliers and Wizards went down
to the final seconds nearly every time they hooked up. Cleveland
defeated Washington in a tense six-game opening-round series,
winning three games by one point, including Games 5 and 6 in
overtime. This one almost went to OT, too, but Washington's  Antawn Jamison 
missed a 3-pointer that would have tied it with 2.9 seconds left. "It was a physical game but we knew that it would be coming
in," James said. "They want to beat us and we want to beat them.
It's become a big rivalry." Hughes, who missed 46 games last season when he had to undergo
two surgeries on a badly broken finger, added nine rebounds and
five assists while battling leg cramps. As usual, James stuffed the
box score with 10 rebounds and five assists in 40 minutes. But James was only 2-for-6 from the line and Cavaliers were an
abysmal 15-of-30 on free throws. Caron Butler  scored 23 points, Jamison 20 and  Etan Thomas  14 for
the Wizards, who spent the summer thinking about what might have
been if they had been able to sneak by the Cavs in the postseason. Gilbert Arenas  had just seven points -- none at halftime -- on
2-of-12 shooting but added 11 assists. "Nobody wants to come out like that on opening night," he
said. "This game definitely reminds me of the (Cleveland) series.
You'd think we'd learn from our mistakes. We have to learn how to
finish these games." Each time the Cavaliers, who led 84-76 with 6:36 left, appeared
on the brink of putting the game away, the Wizards fought back,
using a 10-2 run to tie on two free throws by  Antonio Daniels . James then hit a 3-pointer, and this time Arenas, who matched
his close friend basket for basket in the playoffs, made his only 3
to even it at 89-all. Jamison's basket gave the Wizards their first lead of the second
half but Hughes soared down the lane for a dunk to tie it. James
scored on a scoop to put the Cavaliers ahead by two before Jamison
split a pair of free throws. Cleveland's  Anderson Varejao  went to the line with a chance to
put Cleveland up by three but made only one of two. He was fouled
again after  Jarvis Hayes  missed a 3, but again Cleveland's
frizzy-haired forward could only make one attempt. With the Wizards needing a 3, Arenas inbounded the ball with 6.1
seconds left to Jamison, who instead of giving it back to his
teammate, launched a 3-pointer that was long and James grabbed the
rebound. As is almost always the case, James was involved in the night's
most spectacular moments. With Cleveland leading by six in the third, he blocked a runner
by Arenas, hustled to the offensive end and drove the baseline to
deliver a reverse dunk to make it 65-57. Then, following a steal, James tipped an alley-oop pass back out
to Hughes, who drained a 3-pointer to give Cleveland an 11-point
advantage. The Cavaliers are beginning the season with higher expectations
than at any time in their franchise's 36-year history. Because of
their strong showing in the playoffs, the Cavaliers have become a
trendy preseason pick to contend for a championship. Before the game, coach Mike Brown expressed concern about his
players letting the preseason predictions go to their heads. "I'm walking into the building and I've got people pounding me
saying, 'Let's get a championship," he said. "We haven't even
played one game yet." It showed. The Cavaliers got off to a seriously sloppy start,
committing eight turnovers in the first quarter and 12 in the first
half (they averaged 13.4 last season) and Cleveland went just
10-of-18 from the free-throw line. Arenas' point total matched his jersey number -- 0 -- in the first
half, missing all five field-goal attempts. Game notes Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said the club is close to
finalizing an agreement to hold some of its training camp and play
a preseason game in China next summer. ... Wizards F Darius
Songaila will undergo back surgery Thursday to repair a herniated
disc. He will be out three months. ... Brown will not give his
opinion to James about playing for the U.S. national team next
summer. Miami coach Pat Riley said recently he hopes  Dwyane Wade 
will take some time off to rest his body after a busy offseason.
"That's LeBron's decision," Brown said. "Maybe if I had a few
championships under my belt I could ask him."
