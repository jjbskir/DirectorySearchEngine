Denver's  Allen Iverson  had 51 against the Lakers on Dec. 5. "LeBron is fantastic," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "I think he's got more passing ability than Magic [Johnson] because he can put it on a dime and with zip. It's a function of his ability to score. He allows people to get free. He's 6-foot-9, and he can see." Rudy Gay  scored 30 for the Grizzlies, and reserve  Juan Carlos Navarro  went 6-for-10 from 3-point range on his way to 26 points.  Mike Conley  had a career-high 20 points, and added seven assists. The teams were tied at 113 at the end of regulation after Navarro's 3-pointer with 10.3 seconds left. James missed the potential game-winner from 19 feet as time expired. 
 Pau Gasol  finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who shot 54 percent from the field. Cleveland shot 53 percent in winning its ninth game in the last 12, and edging two games above .500 (20-18) for the first time since the Cavaliers were 9-7 on Nov. 25. 
 Daniel Gibson  scored 18 for the Cavaliers, and  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  added 14.  Drew Gooden  finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Memphis trailed by as many as 10 early in the fourth, and at one point, James scored 10 straight Cleveland points.

 Neither team could gain much of an advantage the rest of the way, including three more ties in the final 1:28 in regulation. "We don't like having to have a shootout," Cleveland coach Mike Brown said. "We've got to do a better job of finishing when we get up big, and a better job of focusing in on doing the correct things in terms of moving the ball. We had some bad turnovers." James had 13 points, and Gibson added 10 to help Cleveland take a 56-53 lead at halftime. Navarro provided a spark for the Grizzlies with 11 first-half points, and Gay had 10. James leads the league in scoring average in the fourth quarter with 9.4 points, and down the stretch in both regulation and overtime Cleveland had him running the show. In addition to the 25 points in the final two frames, James had four assists. "We have a fourth-quarter team right now that's playing really good basketball," James said. "We didn't get stops like we usually get, but for some odd reason, we know how to execute on the offensive end. We make plays, and we make big plays." For the Grizzlies, it was another missed opportunity. Memphis already is 1-9 in games decided by three points or less. After Tuesday's loss, the Grizzlies are 0-3 in overtime. "Once again, it's a tough game to get over, losing these game by a couple of possessions," Conley said. "I thought we fought hard. We got the game back into overtime. We started off overtime pretty well, but they just kept fighting back at us and got the ball to bounce their way a couple of times."
