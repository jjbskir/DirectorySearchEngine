SALT LAKE CITY -- Jerry Sloan shook a few hands, then walked off the court with no hint of a smile or any recognition that he had just made history. Reaching 1,000 wins as coach of the Jazz was much less important to Sloan than anyone else in the arena after Utah beat the  Oklahoma City Thunder  104-97 on Friday night. Sloan is the only coach in NBA history to win 1,000 games with one team and hasn't wanted a bit of hoopla for any of them. But he couldn't quite escape it Friday as Utah fans chanted "Jerry Sloan!" and "Jer-ry! Jer-ry!" in the final minute. "I wished I could've crawled under the bleachers and got out of there a little quicker," Sloan said with a slight smile. Sloan treated it much like he did when he won his 1,000th game overall as an NBA coach two years ago, thanking the fans who cheered him and then wanting to shift all talk to the game. The Jazz improved to 5-0 for the third time in team history despite letting a 31-point lead slip to eight in the fourth quarter. "It's fun to watch our players," Sloan said. "It's fun to watch them play well and it's a little aggravating when they don't play as well as you'd like." The Jazz improved to 1,000-596 since Sloan took over for Frank Layden almost 20 years ago. "It's an amazing thing. A thousand -- that's a huge number," said  Kyle Korver , who scored 13 for the Jazz. "I'm sure someday he's going to be proud of it, but you know how he is. He's not going to show it." Andrei Kirilenko  had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and  Brevin Knight  added 11 assists in his fifth game as Utah's backup point guard. The Jazz played again without  Deron Williams , who is still recovering from spraining his left ankle late in the preseason. Carlos Boozer  finished with 21 points and nine rebounds,  Mehmet Okur  scored 16 and  Ronnie Brewer  added 11 points for the Jazz. Kevin Durant  scored 24 and  Jeff Green  had 22 points for the Thunder, who were swept by Utah last season when they were the Seattle SuperSonics. The Jazz let the Thunder get back in the game with a poor second half. Utah had 19 turnovers and was just 26-for-36 from the foul line. But the Jazz made up for it by outrebounding Oklahoma City 45-36 and having 31 assists to the Thunder's 15. "In the last 17 minutes of the first half we let them be the aggressive team," said Thunder coach P.J. Carlesimo, who walked to the Jazz bench after the game to shake Sloan's hand. "In the second half, our guys were the more aggressive team. We dug too deep of a hole." The Thunder came back in the third, going 12-for-17 and pulling within 78-63 on six straight points by  Desmond Mason  at the end of the period. The Jazz had seven turnovers in the period and continued to be sloppy in the fourth as the Thunder trimmed the margin to single digits.  Joe Smith  cut the lead to 86-78 midway through the period before the Jazz regrouped with a 13-2 run. Boozer set up Kirilenko for a dunk, then Kirilenko made a pass to Boozer in almost the same spot for another dunk to put the Jazz up 92-80. Knight made a steal to set up a 3-pointer by Kyle Korver that put Utah ahead by 15 with 4:26 left in the game. The Thunder never got closer than 12 again and Jazz fans began the chants for Sloan in the final minute. "It's a tribute to him and all the players and coaches that have worked with him," Carlesimo said. "When it's all said and done, he's absolutely one of the best in our profession." The Thunder scored the first eight points of the game, then went almost 10 minutes without a field goal. After falling behind 10-3, the Jazz went on a 21-0 run and led 29-15 at the end of the first quarter. Utah was 11-for-17 from the floor in the period and had nine assists to Oklahoma City's zero. Utah scored 21 straight in the first quarter while taking a 24-14 lead. The Jazz added a 14-2 run in the second quarter and led 58-29 at halftime. "We can't start out like that," Durant said. "The second half we did a much better job of going out and being the aggressor. We've just got to do that early on and we'll be all right." Game notes  Sloan's overall coaching record is 1,094-717 with the Jazz and  Chicago Bulls . ... Oklahoma City missed its last 13 shots in the first quarter. ... Utah's only other 5-0 starts were in 2000-01 and 1998-99. ... Mason scored 15 of his 18 points in the second half. ... Kirilenko had a nasty black eye after taking a shot to the left side of his face Wednesday night in a win over Portland.
