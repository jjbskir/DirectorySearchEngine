PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The  Portland Trail Blazers  were all quizzed about their recent success.  Jarrett Jack  gave perhaps the most concise reply. "I think it's just a contagious confidence," he said. The Blazers have won five straight, including Wednesday night's 105-95 victory over the  Golden State Warriors .  Travis Outlaw  came off the bench to lead Portland with 22 points and eight rebounds. Outlaw's dunk with 3:20 left gave the Blazers a 100-89 lead, and  James Jones  followed up with a 3-pointer to put it away. The Blazers, who built a 14-point lead early but briefly lost their advantage in the third quarter, had not won five straight since a run last December. Brandon Roy  had 21 points and seven assists, while  Joel Przybilla  had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Portland. Jones added 21 points, also off the bench. "It's the same thing in all of our victories, we've got a number of guys coming to play. It was no different tonight, we had a lot of guys step up," Roy said. Golden State, coming off a victory at home over San Antonio on Tuesday night, has won 12 of its previous 15 games.  Baron Davis  led the Warriors with 23 points and 11 assists. The Blazers were without  LaMarcus Aldridge , the team's leading scorer and rebounder, for the second straight game. Aldridge is day-to-day with plantar fasciitis, a painful foot condition. Additionally, the Blazers lost forward  Martell Webster  during the game because of the flu. Starting guard  Monta Ellis  did not play for Golden State because of a strained left thigh. "Definitely not having Monta out there is a big problem,"  Stephen Jackson  said. "We play a lot faster. It slowed us down a lot and we didn't have an extra ball handler out there." Both teams were playing the second of back-to-back games. The Warriors beat the Spurs 96-84 at home on Tuesday night, while the Blazers won 97-89 at Utah. "Tonight I thought the guys, even short-handed, really stepped up and showed how they have grown in the last week," Blazers coach Nate McMillan said. "I really think the whole team is getting a feel of what we want to do." Tied at 22 after the first quarter, the Blazers went on a 20-6 run capped by Jones' 3-pointer and a pair of free throws, to go up 42-28. Golden State came back to close within 51-46 on  Austin Croshere 's 3-pointer, and trailed by 54-49 at the half. The Warriors continued their comeback after the break and narrowed it to 61-60 on Stephen Jackson's steal and dunk. Davis gave Golden State the lead with a 16-foot jumper. The Blazers regrouped and pulled ahead with a 12-2 run, going up 79-69 after Jones' jumper. "We were beaten by a better team tonight and that will happen," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "We didn't play well enough to win and they did." The Blazers raised their home record to 8-3. "You come in here and you want to win, you're going to have to take it from us," Jack said. "We're not giving anything away." Game notes  The Portland Trail Blazers and the Rose Garden are looking for a corporate partner to buy naming rights for the arena. It is the first time a corporate-naming partnership has been offered at the Rose Garden since it opened in 1995. The team and arena are both affiliates of Vulcan, Inc., which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. ... Stephen Jackson, having an off night from the floor, fouled out with 3:49 left. "I'm still trying to figure out what's considered a foul and what's not a foul," the 7-year veteran said. "I got to read the players' manual. I'm confused right now." ... It was Przybilla's second double-double of the season, and his seventh game with at least 10 rebounds. Przybilla is seeing more playing time in Aldridge's absence.
