PHOENIX (AP) -- With his team in a deep hole, Jerry Sloan turned
to his bench. The result was a big rally and a tough road win for
the  Utah Jazz . Carlos Boozer  dunked with 31 seconds left for the go-ahead score
and the Jazz finished the game on a 13-3 run to beat the Phoenix
Suns 108-104 on Friday night. But the Jazz never would have been in position to win had it not
been for reserves  Matt Harpring ,  Derek Fisher  and  Gordan Giricek  --
inserted by Sloan with his team down by 15 points in the third
quarter. It was a luxury the depth-shy Jazz of a year ago could not
have afforded. "I'm going to tell you what happened. The bench came in and
gave us a big boost," Boozer said. "It gave us energy and they're
the ones that got us back in the game." Boozer had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Jazz, who trailed
101-95 after  Leandro Barbosa 's two free throws with 2:26 to play. Phoenix still led 103-101 on  Steve Nash 's two free throws with
1:10 left. But Harpring was fouled by  James Jones  on a layup and
made the three-point play to put Utah ahead 104-103 with 57 seconds
remaining. Kurt Thomas  made one free throws with 44 seconds left to tie it
at 104. Boozer broke free after a tussle with Thomas for the ball to get
the go-ahead stuff. Barbosa missed an open baseline layup that
would have tied it. "I don't know what happened," Barbosa said. "I thought the
ball was going to go in. I think I gave the ball too much spin on
the backboard. Nobody likes this ball. It's OK. We've got to keep
it up. We have another game tomorrow, but it was a tough one." Fisher's two free throws with 9.3 seconds left sealed the
victory. "They're a tough team to guard but we did our best," Harpring
said, "and we took advantage of some mismatches that they gave
us." It was the second time in their three games that the Suns failed
to hold on to a big lead. "We're just not quite in synch," Suns coach Mike D'Antoni
said. "We have a couple of guys that are out of synch. I've got to
get them back in there and get them playing. The bright spot is
that in all the games we've been in we're up by 19, 15 -- we just
can't hold it." Barbosa, inserted into the starting lineup in place of Boris
Diaw, scored 22 points, nine in the final 5  minutes, but was just
5-for-15 from the field.  Shawn Marion  had 19 points and Nash added
17 points and 10 assists.  Raja Bell  scored 17 points before fouling
out with 4:37 remaining. Fisher scored 18 points and Harpring had 17 for Utah. Andrei
Kirilenko had 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Jazz, who
outrebounded Phoenix 48-32. There were 69 free throws in the game --
Phoenix was 31-of-35, Utah 28-of-34. Marion's 3-pointer and Bell's breakaway layup put Phoenix ahead
71-56 and drew a timeout by Sloan. "They kind of quit on me for a little bit there," Sloan said.
"We had a stretch where we didn't look like we wanted to win the
game." In came the reserves, and Utah responded with a 10-0 surge,
including two 3-pointers by Giricek, to cut it to 71-66 with 3:42. Utah's run reached 21-5 and the Jazz took the lead 77-76 on two
free throws with Fisher with 1:47 left in the third. Marion's
3-pointer put Phoenix back on top 79-77 and the Suns led 83-77
entering the fourth quarter. "I thought we were in control to close it out," Marion said.
"They made some tough shots, and I think we were a little
undersized there for a minute. They're a big team. We've got to
learn from this. We've got to get together and understand we still
need work. It ain't supposed to be a cakewalk for us." Game notes The Suns reached a contract agreement with G-F  Jalen Rose 
earlier in the day and expect him in uniform for Wednesday night's
game in San Antonio. ... Marion had two steals and needs two more
to become the fourth player in Suns history to reach 1,000 in his
career. ... Sloan has a losing record against just three teams --
Phoenix (40-41), Indiana (21-23) and San Antonio (34-47). ... The
Jazz blew a 13-point lead with 12 second-quarter turnovers.
