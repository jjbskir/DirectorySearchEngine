 Jack, who recently moved into the starting lineup, scored the Pacers' final six points to help them finally pull out a close game. The losses during their skid had come by a total of 12 points, and they nearly blew this one after leading by 11 in the second half. "We had the game in hand until the end and they made a run," Indiana forward  Danny Granger  said. "And thanks to Jarrett Jack we pulled it out, because he was big for us down the stretch." Jack's 19-footer came in front of Knicks guard  Chris Duhon , his cousin. "Family reunions, I'm up one, but we only played them once," Jack said. "Who knows? He might hit one on me one day." Al Harrington  scored 22 of his 27 points in the second half against his former team, and  David Lee  added 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who committed 21 turnovers that led to 24 points. "That's what you call beating yourself, when you do that," Harrington said. "I had my fair share. We all did, and that's something we usually don't do." The Knicks never led until a flurry of 10 straight points midway through the fourth quarter. Harrington scored the first four, and buckets by Lee and  Wilson Chandler  gave New York a 96-93 edge with 3:31 to play. After an Indiana timeout,  Nate Robinson  drove past  T.J. Ford  for a five-point lead. The Pacers blocked two shots and forced a turnover on the Knicks' next three possessions, scoring six straight to regain the lead at 99-98 on  Troy Murphy 's tip. Harrington gave the Knicks one more lead, but Jack knocked down a jumper, then made a layup on Indiana's next trip for a 103-100 advantage. Chandler's three-point play after a strong drive to the hoop tied it, but the Pacers calmly brought the ball down for Jack's go-ahead jumper. Robinson missed a tough 3-point try as time expired. "That was a good win for us," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "It's nice to battle and come from five down, and last couple of minutes Jarrett Jack was absolutely terrific for us and really carried us down the stretch." Granger scored 22 points, and Murphy added 15 points and 18 boards for the Pacers, who had been 0-8 on Fridays. They continued their recent dominance of the Knicks, having swept the series for the first time last season. Robinson finished with 15 points on just 4-of-14 shooting, while Chandler was 5-of-15 and scored 13. The Knicks have lost four straight at Madison Square Garden, where they haven't won since Dec. 7. "Our defense in the first half wasn't good enough. Then in the second half they fought back," Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We really picked up our defense. Again, that's a tough one to lose." Roy Hibbert  made all four shots for eight points in the first quarter, helping Indiana build a 27-23 lead. The Pacers had a 53-44 advantage at halftime, with Jack making four of their seven 3-pointers. Harrington scored 11 points in the third quarter, but the Knicks couldn't make much of a run, closing only to 83-77 entering the final period. Game notes  Knicks president Donnie Walsh wasn't aware what discussions  Stephon Marbury  was having with other teams, a day after ESPN.com reported the banished guard could end up in Boston. However, while the report said Marbury's ability to secure his release from the Knicks was a potential sticking point, Walsh seemed to indicate the delay in getting anything done was caused by Marbury, who has refused to give up much or any of his $20.8 million salary. "If it is [true], then that would seem to be motivation to try and talk," Walsh said of the report. "If you're going to do a buyout, then it takes two to tango." ... O'Brien said  Mike Dunleavy , out all season with a right knee injury, could return within a week or so. Dunleavy must have wished he could play Friday: He had three 36-point games, matching his career high, against the Knicks last season. ... Duhon received some mail from the White House: Two pictures featuring himself and first lady Laura Bush from when the Knicks guard spoke at the National Book Festival and the Library of Congress in the fall.
