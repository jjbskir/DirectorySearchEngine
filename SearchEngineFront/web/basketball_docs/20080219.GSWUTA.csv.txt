SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The  Utah Jazz  ran with the fast-paced  Golden State Warriors  early, then ran over them. The Jazz returned from the All-Star break with a 119-109 victory over the Warriors on Tuesday, overcoming a sloppy defensive performance in the first quarter by dominating the next two and winning their 13th straight at home. The Jazz scored 77 in the first half and closed the second period on a 10-0 run, shutting out the NBA's highest-scoring team for the final 1:56 before halftime. The offensive spectacle thrilled the fans and irked Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, who wondered where Utah's defense went over the break. The Jazz were six points off the franchise record for a half, but also allowed the Warriors to score 64. "We were happy with the 77. We were up 13, so we can't complain," point guard  Deron Williams  said. "We could have done a better job of helping each other out, but it was a pretty solid game for our first game back." Williams finished with 29 points and 12 assists. He also had two blocks and two steals as Utah swept the season series against the Warriors. All-Star  Carlos Boozer  had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and  Mehmet Okur  also had a double-double with 16 points and 10 boards.  Andrei Kirilenko  added 18 points for the Jazz, who have won 13 of 14. Al Harrington  scored 21 points and  Monta Ellis  had 18 for the Warriors. Neither played in the fourth quarter as coach Don Nelson benched his starters with the game getting out of control. "The only good thing about the game tonight for us is that this is the last time we have to play in Utah," Nelson said. The Jazz beat the Warriors in five games last spring in the second round of the playoffs and took all three meetings this season. It's Utah's first sweep of Golden State since 2001-02. Williams got his 12th double-double in the last 13 games and 31st of the season. Boozer had his 37th game with double figures in scoring and rebounds. He also had 14 points and 10 rebounds in his All-Star debut on Sunday. The Jazz were 15-for-21 in the second period and 30-for-44 (68 percent) in the first half. Utah also outrebounded Golden State 45-33. The Warriors didn't score in the period after  Stephen Jackson 's 3-pointer got the Warriors within 67-64 with 1:56 left. Although the Warriors lead the league in scoring, they're also last in points allowed. It was a bad combination to bring to Utah on Tuesday. "Our motto is keep the score tight and keep the game as close as possible and under double-digits going into the fourth quarter," said  Baron Davis , who had 17 points and four assists. "We weren't able to do that tonight." Golden State's reserves were able to slowly cut into the lead in the fourth quarter -- not nearly enough to win, but plenty to irritate Sloan. "The second half we looked like we thought we had the game won," Sloan said. "As it turned out, I thought I was going to have to substitute at the end of the ballgame." Kyle Korver  and  Matt Harpring  added 12 points for the Jazz, who made their first eight shots of the second quarter and outscoring the Warriors 41-28.
