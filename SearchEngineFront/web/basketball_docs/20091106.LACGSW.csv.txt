OAKLAND, Calif. --  Chris Kaman  and  Baron Davis  are starting to connect and that's good news for the  Los Angeles Clippers  center. Kaman had 22 points and nine rebounds in 28 minutes and the Clippers ended a seven-game losing streak in the Oakland Arena with a 118-90 victory over the  Golden State Warriors  on Friday night. "I'm getting better at feeling out his game," Kaman said of his relationship with the point guard. "I didn't get to do a lot of that last year. I'm getting more comfortable playing with him and I'm trying to be ready when he throws the ball. He makes great plays and I just try to recover, get the ball and put it in the basket." Davis scored 16 of his 25 points in the third quarter as the Clippers won their second straight after opening the season with four losses.  Eric Gordon  added 25 points for Los Angeles and  DeAndre Jordan  scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter.  Sebastian Telfair  also scored 13 points for the Clippers. "We had to have good shots," Davis said. "Chris Kaman was able to be that big body and get some nice baskets for us." Anthony Morrow  had 18 points and  Stephen Jackson  added 17 for the Warriors, who were coming off their first win of the season.  Anthony Randolph  had 13 points and 14 rebounds for Golden State, while  Monta Ellis  added 14 points and  Kelenna Azubuike  13. "Sometimes the effort is there but we're four games into the season and we've got guys hurt already," Jackson said. "It's a terrible start and that does nothing but get contagious. If you're going to blame somebody, I'll take the blame. I've been doing it since I got here." The Warriors made 6 of 21 shots in the third quarter and were outscored 34-16. The Clippers, who were playing for the first time since beating Minnesota on Monday night, shot 67 percent from the field in the first quarter and opened a double-digit lead which they never lost. "Really we just fell apart," Morrow said. "It was a tough night. It's the NBA. It happens sometimes." Warriors starting center  Mikki Moore  was no match for Kaman, who is enjoying his best start to a season. Moore, a 12-year veteran, was limited to two missed shots, four rebounds and four personal fouls in his 18 minutes. "We were able to pound them in the paint because we knew they had some injuries with some of their bigs," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "We have the tendency to get careless, but not tonight." Jackson took exception to the fans' reception of Davis, who was making his second appearance in Oakland since leaving the Warriors. Davis was booed every time he touched the ball. "Baron is a great player," Jackson said. "What upsets me is they boo him but they have short memories. They forgot the reason they're still coming here is because of what he did when he was here. The organization was in the trash can before we had that year." The Clippers took a 91-61 lead into the final quarter and rested most of their starters in the fourth quarter with a Saturday night game looming against Memphis in the Staples Center. Gordon and Kaman combined to shoot nearly 69 percent (11 of 16) while the rest of the team shot 50 percent (10 of 20) in the first half as the Clippers built a 19-point lead before settling for a 57-45 lead at halftime.
