OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --  Jason Richardson  has been on the unpleasant end of innumerable blowout losses in this building, and he still feels a twinge of regret that he's no longer on the team that's now handing them out instead of taking them. Monta Ellis  scored 21 points,  Stephen Jackson  had 19 and the Warriors made Richardson miserable in his return to Golden State with a 127-96 victory over the  Charlotte Bobcats  on Friday night. Richardson had 10 points on 2-of-9 shooting, despite multiple standing ovations in the arena where he became the downtrodden Golden State fans' most consistent favorite during six seasons with the club. Just after things finally got good for Richardson last spring during the Warriors' exciting playoff run, they abruptly traded him to lowly Charlotte. Richardson appreciated the love in Oakland, but left town with yet another loss and two ailing teammates.  Gerald Wallace  had trouble getting out of his uniform after spraining his left ankle, and  Raymond Felton  sprained his right ankle while the Bobcats fell behind by 34 points in the third quarter against the speedy Warriors. "It was very tough -- a lot of memories," Richardson said. "You see the [No.] 23 jerseys out there. It was moving. ... I guess I left a good impression here. The fans here are hardcore. It was nice to hear the ovation. I do miss it, but it's time to move on. I have to move on." With new acquisition  Chris Webber  watching from the bench, the Warriors rolled to their ninth win in 12 games.  Baron Davis  had just five points and six assists in his first game since being snubbed for an All-Star spot on the Western Conference's loaded team, but Golden State needed little help from its catalyst to finish off the wounded Bobcats. "I don't remember the last time we had a blowout," coach Don Nelson said. "It seems like they've all been close, or we've been blown out. It's really good, the right thing for our team, heading into Chris Webber's minicamp." With five days before the Warriors' next game, Nelson canceled a scheduled Super Bowl break and planned five straight days of practice to work on timing with Webber, who re-signed with the club on Tuesday. Golden State can't execute much better than it did against the Bobcats, however. "It was a lot of fun," said  Al Harrington , who hit two 3-pointers after learning he won't be able to use his Super Bowl tickets. "They have a lot of good guys that can play, but we made shots and played well on the defensive end. We should come out next week with a lot of confidence from this game and from the practice that's about to happen." Emeka Okafor  had 20 points and 18 rebounds in the Bobcats' third loss in four games. Felton, who had 16 points, and Wallace both sat out the fourth quarter for Charlotte, which has two games left on its longest West Coast trip of the season. "It was more precautionary," coach Sam Vincent said. "We need them for [Saturday's game at Denver]. We didn't want to chance something when we have another game tomorrow. Let them get some rest. ... It didn't look like we were coming back, [so] it was time to get ready for Denver." Earl Boykins , the 5-foot-5 former Warriors guard, made his debut with Charlotte late in the first quarter. Boykins, who finished with five points and four assists in 23 minutes, signed with the Bobcats on Thursday to provide backcourt depth -- and they might need it if Felton's injury turns out to be serious. Richardson started aggressively against his former teammates, but went just 1-for-8 in the first half as the Warriors sped away with one of their best halves of the season. Jackson hit three 3-pointers as Golden State made a 21-2 run, eventually taking a 28-point lead midway through the second quarter with 61.4 percent shooting. Charlotte trimmed the lead to 14 points, but Golden State finished the third quarter with a 21-4 run behind  Mickael Pietrus , who had 13 points in the period as Golden State went ahead 101-67. Every played in uniform scored at least four points for the Warriors, with six in double figures. Webber, who won the Rookie of the Year award with Golden State in 1994 before leaving in a fight with Nelson, hopes to suit up for the Warriors in their next game against Chicago on Thursday. But the Warriors found a clever way to make sure Webber wouldn't be booed in his first game back in Oakland nearly 14 years after forcing a trade that crippled the franchise for well over a decade. They showed a video montage of Webber's highlights from his season with Golden State on a split screen with a montage of Richardson, and the cheers for J-Rich drowned out a few scattered boos for C-Webb. Game notes  Webber will wear his old No. 4 with the Warriors. G CJ Watson relinquished it this week, switching to No. 23 -- Richardson's old number. ... Wright, whose meager minutes figure to decrease with Webber's arrival, got the crowd on its feet with a stunning one-handed dunk on a fast break in the fourth quarter.
