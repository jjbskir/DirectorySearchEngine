MIAMI (AP) -- The  Miami Heat  had half a team, and even less of a chance against the  Golden State Warriors . Stephen Jackson  scored 22 points,  Baron Davis  had 15 points and 10 assists and the Warriors eased past the severely short-handed Heat 134-99 on Friday night, handing Miami its biggest loss of a dismal season. Miami only had seven available players and was without  Dwyane Wade , out because of left knee soreness. "We didn't think they were going to lay down because Wade didn't play," Jackson said. The Heat played the final 4 1/2 minutes with one available substitute, after  Udonis Haslem  tweaked a gimpy ankle. He will not play Saturday in Miami's doubleheader of sorts at Atlanta. Al Harrington  had 17 points,  Monta Ellis  scored 16 and  Mickael Pietrus  finished with 15 for Golden State, which eclipsed the 100-point mark for the 25th straight game and has won five of its last six. The Warriors also scored more points than anyone managed against Miami all season, topping Chicago's 126 on Jan. 16. "Everything was clicking," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "And we played an awful good game." Chris Quinn  and  Marcus Banks  each scored 20 points for the NBA-worst Heat, who lost for the 30th time in their last 33 games.  Shawn Marion  had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Haslem finished with 17 points for Miami. "Knowing they only had seven players, we just wanted to push the tempo," Davis said. The Warriors did that with ease. Jackson made three 3-pointers in a span of 2:09 late in the opening quarter, setting the tone for Golden State's night. He and Harrington each connected on four 3-pointers in the first half alone, and the Warriors steadily built what was a 63-51 lead at intermission. If there was any doubt, the Warriors erased it in the third quarter. Golden State outscored Miami 37-22 in that period, stretching the lead to 100-73 entering the final 12 minutes, during which the Warriors essentially stayed on cruise control. Ellis had 14 points in the third, when the Warriors shot 73 percent (16-22) from the floor. "I was surprised that they gave up so early," Pietrus said. Wade could only watch helplessly from Miami's bench. "Having to sit there and watch them go through it, it's never pleasant at all," Wade said. Since Wade arrived, the Heat are 33-41 without him, 1-9 this season, but he was hardly the only absence of note for Miami in this one. NBA rules mandate that a team have eight players in uniform for a game, and the Heat met that requirement; Wade and  Earl Barron  (sore right knee) were the eighth and ninth men in uniform, although neither played. The rest of the 15-man roster was unavailable because of an array of roster moves, suspensions and injuries. "I thought our games came with the right attitude tonight and everything," Heat coach Pat Riley said. "We just got absolutely outplayed by a better team." The Heat had their moments, like Williams' behind-the-back pass to Marion for a dunk, Quinn's double-clutching 3-pointer at the buzzer of the first quarter, and Banks' acrobatic layup where he got fouled, slammed into the basket stanchion and then dodged photographers seated along the baseline. But few teams with seven guys could sustain the pace needed to stay with the Warriors. "Maybe back in AAU days was the last time I played with seven guys," Quinn said. "But it is what it is. We're all still NBA players." Wade will be a game-time decision Saturday when Miami visits Atlanta for both a regularly scheduled game and the final 51.9 seconds of overtime from a suspended game that began Dec. 19. Miami will have  Daequan Cook  and  Joel Anthony ; the Heat rookies were summoned back from the NBDL to meet the team in Atlanta. Game notes  The Warriors used nine players in the second quarter, and all of them scored in the period. ... Quinn, who gives up four inches and at least 40 pounds to Pietrus, was called for a flagrant foul against the Golden State forward midway through the third quarter after a collision under the basket. ... A pregame highlight: U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Emmanuel Cuevas, honored as part of the Heat's "Home Strong" initiative where they welcome home soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan, proposed to girlfriend Cindy Diaz at midcourt. She accepted, and the Heat coaches congratulated the couple as they left the floor. ... Miami used its 21st starting lineup of the season. It used 20 last year.
