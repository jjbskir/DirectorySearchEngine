INDIANAPOLIS (AP) --  Vince Carter  is healthy again, and so is his scoring average. Back at full strength after a bout with the flu, Carter scored 28 points and  Clifford Robinson , the oldest player in the NBA, added a season-high 14 to lead the  New Jersey Nets  over the  Indiana Pacers  100-91 Friday night. "This is a big victory for us, mentally," Carter said. "I think we've been up and down a little bit, winning one, losing one, so it's big for us to come out and put together two wins in a row." A weakened Carter, fourth in the league in scoring, had a season-low 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting in a victory over Milwaukee on Wednesday. He nearly matched that with 13 points in just the first quarter against the Pacers. "I'm fine," he said. "It was just one of those little 24-hour bugs that you go through." Indiana's  Jermaine O'Neal , in foul trouble and scoreless in the first half, had 13 points in the third quarter as the Pacers came from 14 points down to take a 75-71 lead early in the final period. Two free throws by rookie  Marcus Williams  and a 3-pointer by Robinson put the Nets back in the lead. After two more ties,  Bostjan Nachbar  got a dunk off an assist by  Jason Kidd , was fouled by O'Neal and hit the free throw for an 82-79 lead. Baskets by Carter and  Nenad Krstic  pushed the Nets' lead to 94-89 with under 2 minutes to go and the Pacers never recovered. "It was a classic example of bending but not breaking," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "Indiana made a furious run in that third quarter, but we were able to take their hit, maintain our poise and find a way to win. "Vince is our closer, and he brings it home for us." Krstic finished with 18 points and Kidd had 17. The 14 by the 39-year-old Robinson topped his previous season high of 12 against Milwaukee on Wednesday. "We're just looking for consistency," Robinson said. "To come in and get this win, it feels good." Al Harrington , also in foul trouble much of the game, led Indiana with 18 points, while O'Neal finished with 17 and  Jamaal Tinsley  16. Marquis Daniels  added 14 points and gave the Pacers got a big lift off the bench after O'Neal and Harrington left with their third fouls early in the second quarter. "We had some good stretches, but we got off to another terrible start. It's something you can't do in this league, especially at home," Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. "We got some good energy off the bench. ... We got the lead back, but Jersey's a good team. They're damn talented. They made more plays than we did." A flurry of 3-pointers, including two by Carter and one by Robinson, helped New Jersey to a 39-25 lead 5 minutes into the second period. But Daniels, who broke out of a slump with a season-high 15 points in a loss at Boston on Wednesday, hit a 3-pointer, a fast-break layup and free throw in less than a minute. After Krstic made one of two free throws, Tinsley scored and Daniels stole the ball and fed  Stephen Jackson  for another basket to complete Indiana's 10-1 run. The teams traded baskets until the closing minutes of the half. Krstic scored the Nets' final seven points, though, including a basket and free throw with 41 seconds left to give New Jersey a 51-41 lead at the break. O'Neal got his first two baskets early in the third quarter and three in a row midway through the period to bring Indiana within 60-55. Darrell Armstrong  and  Danny Granger  hit 3-pointers late in the period to make it 71-70, then another 3-pointer by Granger at the start of the fourth quarter gave the Pacers their first lead since 4-2 in the opening minutes. "We've got some guys that are struggling and we're struggling as a team," Carlisle said. "We've got to fight through it. We knew the beginning of the season was going to be a challenging stretch. But we're not getting any sympathy from other teams. This is what you go through." Game notes  It was the first game between the Nets and Pacers this season; Indiana won two of three games last season but was eliminated by New Jersey in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. ... Pacers reserve center  David Harrison  missed the game with a sore left shoulder. ... Indiana's slumping Jackson, shooting 34 percent for the season, had seven points on 3-of-11 from the field and 1-of-4 free throws. ... Kidd, who had nine rebounds and six assists, needs one triple-double to tie Wilt Chamberlain's 78 for third in NBA career triple-doubles; Oscar Robertson holds the record with 181, and Magic Johnson is second with 138. ... Krstic had scored at least 20 points in a career-high three straight games.
