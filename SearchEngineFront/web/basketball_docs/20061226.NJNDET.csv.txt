AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- For most of Tuesday night, the
 Detroit Pistons  were angry about the officiating. In the end, though, the  New Jersey Nets  were the ones screaming.

 Billups Chauncey Billups shot 1-for-10 from the field, but his two free throws with 7.2 seconds left gave the Pistons a 92-91 win over the Nets. Billups is the first player with no more than one field goal to sink game-tying and game-winning free throws in the final ten seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime since Reggie Miller did it at New Orleans on Nov. 21, 2003.

 Chauncey Billups  made two free throws with 7.2 seconds left, and
 Vince Carter  didn't get a last-second call as the Pistons won their
fifth straight, 92-91. "We come to work, and we work extremely hard at this, only for
the officials to screw us,"  Jason Kidd  said. "We fought, but that
doesn't mean anything when you have the officials take over the
game like that. You go with the Three Blind Mice, and it's just sad
that Tom (Washington) screwed up that game for us." Billups, who missed nine of his 10 shots from the floor, was
fouled by Carter on a fast break after Kidd missed a 3-pointer that
could have clinched the game. "I love games like this," Billups said. "Even though I
struggled, it's great to be in games that you know are going down
to the wire and that someone's going to have to make a play." On the ensuing possession, Carter missed a pull-up jumper with
1.5 seconds to go after a collision that knocked  Rasheed Wallace  to
the court. Nets coach Lawrence Frank argued the call and had to be
restrained by assistant coaches from going after the officials at
the buzzer. "It's obviously a foul," Frank said. "But that's how the game
works. They aren't going to change it. Never in the history of the
game have they reversed a call." Even Wallace, who picked up one of Detroit's three second-half
technicals, wasn't sure what the officials were going to do. "That one could have gone either way," he said. "He put his
shoulder down, and I tried to take a charge. Earlier in the game,
even earlier in the fourth, they probably call that." Wallace wasn't supposed to be guarding Carter on the play, but
jumped in when  Tayshaun Prince  tripped. "Sheed made an unbelievable play there," Pistons coach Flip
Saunders said. "Tay goes down, and they've got one of the premier
scorers in the league at the top of the key with no one guarding
him. You generally don't want to be playing 5-on-4 with a one-point
lead and five seconds to go." The Pistons got 21 points apiece from Wallace and Richard
Hamilton. Carter had 28 and  Richard Jefferson  added 18 for the
Nets, who have lost three in a row. Kidd finished with 13 points,
nine rebounds and seven assists. The Nets took a 60-58 lead on Carter's 3-pointer with five
minutes left in the third, and were still up 68-67 at period's end.
Carter and Kidd combined for 18 points in the period. Carter kept going in the fourth, scoring eight points in the
first four minutes to help the Nets take an 80-73 lead. The Pistons rallied to tie it at 81 on Hamilton's 3-pointer with
5:17 left, and after  Jason Collins ' jumper, Hamilton put Detroit in
front with a three-point play. The teams traded the lead for the next several possessions, and
the Nets led 90-88 after Collins' free throw with 1:36 left. Prince
tied the game with two foul shots with 1:20 left, but Billups
fouled Jefferson at the other end, and he split his shots. Wallace's turnaround jumper went in-and-out, but he made up for
it by rebounding Kidd's miss and starting the game-winning fast
break. "If we don't get that break, we probably call a timeout,"
Saunders said. "But we had a chance to go, so I let them take
it." Detroit dominated early, leading 15-6 after just four minutes
and keeping the advantage for the entire first half. The Nets
closed the margin against Detroit's reserves in the second, but the
Pistons still held a 47-39 edge at halftime. Wallace had 16 points,
including four 3-pointers. Game notes Antonio McDyess  and Billups picked up third-quarter
technicals, and Wallace got one in the fourth, all for arguing
calls. ... Saunders had a discussion with a heckler during the
second quarter. After the fan called for  Carlos Delfino  to be
benched, Saunders replied "You guys complain when I don't play the
bench, and now you don't want me to play them. Make up your
minds!"
