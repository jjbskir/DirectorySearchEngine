PORTLAND, Ore. --  Brandon Roy  is hopeful the Trail Blazers have weathered a torrent of injuries. Roy scored 22 points before sitting much of the second half because of a tight right hamstring and the  Portland Trail Blazers  beat the  Milwaukee Bucks  120-108 on Wednesday night. Roy, who has been working overtime for the injury-depleted Blazers, went to the locker room with a little more than six minutes left in the game for treatment. He did not return. Asked about his hamstring, he said "It's seen better days." But Roy said he'll be ready when the Blazers host Orlando on Friday. And his hamstring was decidedly minor when it comes to the injuries which have beset the Blazers. "I looked out there at one point and we had a full second lineup out there," he said. "I think that's been the biggest difference in putting teams away, where now we have some depth and guys don't have to play so many minutes. We're just playing good basketball. "I think we're finally understanding this is the team we have and we've got to keep trying to improve with it." Portland, which led by as many as 33 points in the second half, didn't need their two-time All-Star in the end. The Blazers shot 60.3 percent from the field in the game. Ersan Ilyasova  scored 24 points for Milwaukee, which has lost three straight after a three-game winning streak. The Bucks continue to adjust to the prospect of  Michael Redd  being sidelined for the rest of the season. Redd tore ligaments in his left knee for the second time in less than a year on Sunday night in the second quarter of Milwaukee's 95-77 loss to the  Los Angeles Lakers . The Milwaukee guard, who will need surgery, also had surgery in March after tearing the same ligaments last January. Redd, a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team, had already missed 16 games this year with knee soreness and was averaging just 11.9 points in 18 games. But he has been the Bucks' top offensive threat, averaging 20.3 points per game in his career. The Blazers can relate. Portland lost center  Greg Oden  and  Joel Przybilla  to season-ending knee injuries earlier this season. The team saw the return Wednesday of forward  Rudy Fernandez , who had a surgical procedure on his back in early December and missed 19 games. The injury was causing him pain in his right leg. But Portland remained without forward  Nicolas Batum , who had shoulder surgery just before the start of the season, and forward  Travis Outlaw , who fractured his right foot. Fernandez, a fan favorite, was greeted with a standing ovation when he entered as the first quarter wound down. He hit a 16-foot jumper early in the second for a 33-16 Portland lead. "I need to work more on my legs, my breath," said Fernandez, who is from Spain and played on its national team in Beijing. "But I feel good." The Blazers led by as many as 24 points in the first half en route to a 66-46 lead at the break. It got worse for the Bucks in the second: Roy's layup gave Portland an 83-53 lead. But Milwaukee made a run midway through the final quarter, narrowing it to 102-90 on  Charlie Bell 's 3-pointer, but could not make up the deficit. "We had an awful lot to do with them shooting well. They were just in another gear than us and for most of the night, other than first two, three minutes of the game," Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  said. "They were quicker, more athletic went by us pretty much at will. (LaMarcus) Aldridge just turned and shot over us without much resistance and they built a 30-point lead and deserved it." The Bucks were coming off a 105-101 loss in Phoenix. Skiles missed that game because he was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat and assistant Jim Boylan stepped in. Game notes  Blazers rookie guard Patty Mills was assigned Wednesday to the Idaho Stampeded of the NBA's D-League. ... Batum is expected to return by the end of this month, and Outlaw could come back after the All-Star break. ... The Blazers' 66 points in the first half were the most they've had in a half this season.
