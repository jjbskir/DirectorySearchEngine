ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Even Stan Van Gundy wasn't sure what  Hedo Turkoglu  was doing. An off-balance 3-pointer with time running out -- when all the Magic needed to break a 93-all tie against the  Kevin Garnett -less  Boston Celtics  was a two?

Did anything strike you as unusual about Hedo Turkoglu's 25-footer at the buzzer in the Magic's 96-93 victory over the Celtics? It was the first game-winning, walk-off, 3-point field goal in the NBA either of the last two seasons. The last was a 23-footer by Damon Jones of the Cavaliers in a win at Toronto on March 8, 2006.

 "I think he wanted to set it up so he could hit a miracle and make his final bid for the All-Star Game," the Magic coach joked. "If we win by seven, no drama. It doesn't make as good of a case." Turkoglu is having the best season of his career, but he's a long-shot for the Feb. 17 game in New Orleans. He tried a few tough shots down the stretch, as Orlando let go of a double-digit lead, but made the one that counted for a 96-93 win. "I didn't really want to settle on a jumper," Turkoglu said. "I just tried to go to the hole and take a foul, but they had good defense and forced me to take a tough shot. I'm just glad it was right there today." Orlando recorded its second home win this season over Boston, which played for the first time without Garnett, who has an abdominal strain. "Obviously Kevin is the heart and soul of what we do," Celtics guard  Ray Allen  said. "So it was tough not seeing him out there." Dwight Howard  had 18 points and 16 rebounds for Orlando, and  Rashard Lewis  scored 15 points. Orlando blew a 16-point, second-half lead with a lousy fourth quarter. The Celtics trailed 75-65 to open the period, then held Orlando scoreless nearly four minutes, and without a field goal for more than five. But the Celtics slipped into their own fourth-quarter drought over 2:47 and the Magic pulled ahead by eight on two buckets from Lewis, one a 3-pointer, and an authoritative dunk from Howard. Allen hit a 3 for Boston to tie it at 93 with 14 seconds left, and Orlando took its time on the last possession.  Carlos Arroyo  dribbled up the court and held the ball, the fans on their feet screaming. Turkoglu curled around and pulled up an ugly shot, but it went in. "It was a good shot," Celtics forward  Paul Pierce  said. "I thought I played pretty good defense -- cut off his initial drive, he turned around and shot a 3-pointer from two or three feet off the line and sunk the shot." Pierce led Boston with 24 points and nine rebounds, Allen scored 17 points and  Rajon Rondo  had 15 points and five assists. January has been by far Boston's worst stretch -- five of its eight losses have come this month. But the Celtics, at 34-8, are still by far the league's best. The Magic lead the Southeast Division at 28-18, but not by much. "Because they didn't have Kevin Garnett and we hit a miracle shot at the end, it was enough to win," Van Gundy said. The Celtics went the entire first half, and most of the third quarter, without a 3-pointer, but Allen and  James Posey  found them late. Posey nailed one to start the quarter, then Allen hit two within a minute and a half, plus the game-tying shot. The Magic trailed 46-43 at halftime, but opened a double-digit lead with a 22-4 run keyed by forward  Brian Cook , who didn't play in the first half. Acquired with  Maurice Evans  in a November trade that sent  Trevor Ariza  to the  Los Angeles Lakers , Cook immediately started scoring -- nailing three 3-pointers and a putback for 11 in the run. Howard added two three throws, a feat of some magnitude for the 59.6 percent foul shooter, to raucous chants of "M-V-P!" The fourth-year standout is a long-shot candidate, and his Magic were looking good at the time: up 69-53, in the third quarter. But that was with Garnett resting a strained abdominal muscle and Allen on the bench with four fouls. The Celtics outrebounded Orlando through the first half even without Garnett, though the Magic ended up with a 43-38 edge on the boards. And Orlando committed 20 turnovers for 31 Boston points, compared with 12 Celtics turnovers that led to 14 points for the Magic. Posey had 16 points and six rebounds off the bench for Boston, and  Leon Powe  added nine points and nine rebounds. "We don't want to be known as a last-shot team, we want to be a great team," Howard said. "I think we're building up to being a great team." Game notes  Boston has fared far worse against the Southeast Division than the rest of the league. The Celtics are 6-5, having also lost twice to Washington and once to Charlotte. ...

The guard returned favoring it, but finished the game.
