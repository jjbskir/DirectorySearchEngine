SEATTLE (AP) -- It took a 19-year-old with his entire array of skills on display, and the wily experience of a 35-year-old veteran to finally get the  Seattle SuperSonics  a victory at home. An unlikely combo? Sure, especially since  Kevin Durant  keeps reminding  Kurt Thomas  he's old enough to be his dad. "He calls me young fella, I call him old fella," Durant said. Durant, the Sonics' teenage star, scored 22 of his career-high 35 points in the second half, Thomas grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds and the Sonics beat the  Indiana Pacers  95-93 on Friday night, becoming the final NBA team to win at home. Seattle was 0-7 at home and had lost 11 straight home games dating to last season. But Durant showed off the skills that made him the No. 2 overall pick in this year's draft, excelling in the closing minutes to help Seattle (3-14) snap a six-game skid and avoid the worst 17-game start in franchise history. The 1967-68 Sonics started 2-14 as well, before winning their 17th game. "Hopefully we got a little better and we can build on it," Seattle coach P.J. Carlesimo said. Durant made 12 of 20 shots and added five rebounds and three blocks. Seattle ran its offense through Durant in the closing minutes, and the youngster responded by either hitting key shots, finding open teammates or getting to the free-throw line. Durant's only blemish was going 8-of-12 at the line, but Durant made them when they counted, hitting six of eight attempts in the final 2:35 as Seattle hung on. "As long as he continued to go good, we were going to try and continue going to him," Carlesimo said. Danny Granger  led Indiana with 21 points, but the bigger concern for the Pacers was  Jermaine O'Neal , who returned Friday night after missing the previous five games with a sore left knee. O'Neal scored 12 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 27 minutes, but sat the final 2:19 after injuring his right shoulder setting a screen for  Mike Dunleavy . Afterward, O'Neal said he suffered a stinger, though he didn't consider it serious. "I will be all right," O'Neal said. "They didn't feel comfortable putting me in the game at that point." Added coach Jim O'Brien, "We want him in at the end of the game." Granger hit just four of 18 shots, including a meaningless 3-pointer at the buzzer. Dunleavy added 14 and  Shawne Williams  scored 13. Indiana lost for just the second time in its last six games. Durant's two free throws with 20.6 seconds left gave Seattle a 92-88 lead.  Jamaal Tinsley  scored on a baseline runner at the other end and Durant split his next two attempts to give Seattle a 93-90 lead with 12.6 seconds left. Tinsley had a good look at a tying 3-pointer with 5 seconds left but it hit the rim and Durant grabbed the rebound. He then hit both free throw attempts to clinch the victory. "Coach called my number tonight, and I tried to get to the free throw line and knock them down," Durant said. Almost as impressive as Durant's performance, was Thomas controlling the interior. Sixteen of Thomas' 18 rebounds came at the defensive end as the Pacers managed just nine second-chance points. "That still amazes me because he can't jump at all," Durant said with a chuckle. While Thomas was doing yeoman's work, Durant was electrifying the crowd in the second half. Late in the third quarter, Durant swooped across the lane to block Williams' shot. He then hit the final two baskets of the period, the first on a crossover 18-footer, then spinning on Granger and swishing a 15-footer to give Seattle a 70-65 lead. Indiana chipped away, pulling even at 77-all on Dunleavy's fastbreak dunk with 6:18 left. Seattle then scored the next six points, capped by Durant's 3-pointer in front of the Pacers bench for a 83-77 lead with 4:44 left. Indiana pulled to 83-81, before Durant's third 3-pointer gave Seattle a five-point advantage with less than 3 minutes remaining. Seven of Seattle's final nine points came at the free throw line, the only basket coming on a  Damien Wilkins  layup off a perfect pass by Durant. "He has a chance to be in the same conversation as  Tracy McGrady ,  Kobe Bryant ,  LeBron James ," O'Neal said of Durant. "He is going to be a great thing for this league. David Harrison  picked up for O'Neal's rustiness, adding 10 in a reserve role.  Jeff Foster  grabbed 14 rebounds and O'Neal had 10. Tinsley finished with 10 assists.
