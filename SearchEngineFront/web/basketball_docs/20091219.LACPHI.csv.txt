 Chris Kaman  scored 24 points and  Baron Davis  added 20 for the Clippers (12-14). Los Angeles overcame a 28-point night from  Marreese Speights  and 20 from Iguodala. The game was played before a sparse crowd of about 2,600 at Wachovia Center who braved a winter storm that dumped one to two feet of snow in the area. Lou Williams  returned to Philadelphia's lineup after missing 12 games with a broken jaw, scoring six points in 23 minutes. His ahead-of-schedule return was welcome news to a team that was again without newly acquired  Allen Iverson , who missed his second straight game with arthritis in his left knee. Iverson had the knee drained twice this week. The Clippers blew a 16-point, third-quarter lead and nearly lost on Iguodala's jumper as time expired in the fourth. The shot was waved off after it was ruled he did not get it off in time. "We thought it was good," Iguodala said. "I think I got it off before the buzzer, but not before the red light. The replay was really close. It's unfortunate." "We relied on the best player to make the play," head coach Eddie Jordan said. "Unfortunately, it was about a tenth a second too late." The Clippers led right after the opening tip in overtime and never trailed again. "[We knew] the first team to make that run was going to win the game," said  Al Thornton , who contributed 12 points. "As soon as the jump ball, we were trying to get the lead, get some stops and establish some momentum. We were able to do that." For the second straight night the Clippers let a double-digit lead evaporate. It cost them on Friday night, when the  New York Knicks  won after overcoming a 20-point deficit. On Saturday, the Sixers chipped away in the third quarter, cutting a 60-47 deficit to five points entering the fourth. They took the lead in the final quarter, and the teams traded leads several times in the final minutes, with Speights and  Eric Gordon  trading big scores. "We played well in overtime," Kaman said. "We had a third-quarter problem once again, but overcame it. We're getting a step closer every time. I'm getting excited for this team. We've been playing pretty well." The Sixers (7-20) lost some momentum a day after beating the  Boston Celtics , and may have lost some energy after Iguodala's shot was waved off. "We're only human," Jordan said. "As much as you want to get re-energized, we could have, but I think the first play, we turned it over. Right from the beginning they had a little juice because of their defensive stand." Game notes  Before the game, Sixers guard  Jrue Holiday  took the microphone to thank the fans who braved the severe weather to attend Saturday's game.
