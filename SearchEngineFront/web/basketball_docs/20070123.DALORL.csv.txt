ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- It took  Dirk Nowitzki  more than 60 games last season to reach 26 double-doubles. He topped that mark in 2007 on Tuesday night after only 43 outings. Nowitzki's defending Western Conference champion  Dallas Mavericks  are also ahead of schedule, beating the  Orlando Magic  111-95 for their 35th win of the season. Nowitzki had 33 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, and  Josh Howard  added 25 points. It was the Mavericks' 21st victory in 22 games, and it kept them ahead of last season's franchise-record 60-win pace. How good is Dallas? To the weak Eastern Conference, scary good. "We're about as hungry as it gets," Nowitzki said. "We were so close last year. It was a very, very disappointing loss at the end. But more than anything it's motivation for us to work even harder this year." For the second consecutive night, after beating the  Miami Heat  in a rematch of last year's NBA finals, the Mavericks led from beginning to end. Dallas was up 16 at the end of the first quarter and pushed the margin to 25 points in the second with a 15-5 run capped by Nowitzki's three-point play. The Mavericks kept it around 20 points most of the second and third periods. Orlando pulled within 11 points in the third with a 13-4 run, but it happened with Nowitzki resting. It was the closest the Magic had been since 8 minutes into the first quarter, and aside from a quick basket to begin the fourth, it was the closest they would come. Dallas rattled off six unanswered points, including a fast-break dunk from Nowitzki, to put the lead back at 14 and out of Orlando's reach. "We saw a pretty good team," Magic coach Brian Hill said. "Obviously, we can't spot a team a 16-point first quarter, especially a good team like that, and win the game. They ran by us early in the game, shot over us, went around us to start the game and we tried to play catch-up from that point on. It was too hard to do with a team of this caliber." Jameer Nelson  scored 23 points for the Magic and keyed the third-quarter run that brought Orlando back into the game.  Hedo Turkoglu  scored 17,  Grant Hill  had 15 points and  Dwight Howard  finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds. Dwight Howard attempted only 10 shots from the field, even though all three Dallas big men (Eric Dampier,  DeSagana Diop  and  DJ Mbenga ) were in foul trouble most of the game. Jason Terry  had 14 points and six assists for the Mavericks, and  Devin Harris  had 13 points. Nowitzki scored at will on a 12-for-17 performance of mid-range jumpers, layups and drives -- and the rest of the Mavericks weren't far behind in the first half. Dallas shot 26-of-40 from the field, including 8-of-11 by Josh Howard for 18 points in the period. Josh Howard went cold in the second and third quarters, scoring seven points on 1-for-7 shooting. Orlando hit 44 percent for the game, to 55 percent for the Mavericks. "We knew they were riding off a back-to-back, so we wanted to get out there and run, and we just stuck to the game plan," Josh Howard said. The Magic couldn't find open shots all night, picking up most of their 12 turnovers (for 18 Dallas points) on tipped or errant passes. Guards were forced several times into hesitant, last-second shots after dribbling around the perimeter and finding no one open. Game notes  Dallas had lost seven of its last eight in Orlando by an average of 12 points. ... It was Orlando's first time in three games scoring less than 100 points. The Magic had gone five games before that under 100.
