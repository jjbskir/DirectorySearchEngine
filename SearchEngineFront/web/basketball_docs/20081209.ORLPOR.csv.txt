 Orlando made three 3-pointers during the final 1:57, including  Hedo Turkoglu 's 25-footer that banked in with 0.3 seconds left, and rallied to beat Portland 109-108 on Tuesday night. Southeast Division-leading Orlando (17-5) went 14-of-27 from 3-point range.  Rashard Lewis , who led the Magic with 27 points, hit six 3-pointers, while  Jameer Nelson  had four. But the biggest shot came from Turkoglu, whose shot was set up following a timeout with 5 seconds remaining. Orlando gained a last-ditch chance to win the game when the Magic forced Portland into a 24-second violation. Turkoglu's name was barely mentioned during the timeout. Orlando coach Stan Van Gundy said the play was meant to go to Lewis or Nelson, with Turkoglu as the last option. With Lewis and Nelson pressured, Turkoglu got the ball, dribbled near the top of the key and let the shot fly. "I just dribbled hard and jumped. The shot went in," said Turkoglu, who scored 24 points. Van Gundy admitted the Magic got lucky in the end. "That was just brilliant, brilliant coaching down the stretch," Van Gundy said. "If you're [the Blazers], you've got to roll your eyes, because we threw one in." To get to the lucky part, Orlando had to make some plays. The Magic led throughout most of the first half, but needed a last-second basket by Turkoglu to take a 49-48 halftime lead. Portland (15-8) and Orlando traded leads throughout the third quarter before the Blazers used a 12-0 run to seize control early in the fourth quarter. It appeared Portland was on its way to its eighth win in nine games, as the Blazers led by eight points on several occasions during the fourth quarter, including 108-100 on  LaMarcus Aldridge 's 19-foot jumper with 2:21 left. Portland didn't score again, as Orlando changed its defensive strategy on  Brandon Roy , who scored a season-high 30 points. The Magic decided to trap Roy each time he touched the ball down the stretch. The defensive ploy worked, as the Blazers went 0-for-4 with two turnovers during the final two minutes. "We couldn't stop him, so we wanted to make someone else beat us," Lewis said. The defensive plan, combined with sharp perimeter shooting, proved to be a winning formula for Orlando, which won for the eighth time in nine games. Nelson, Lewis and Turkoglu each hit a 3-pointer during the final 1:57 to complete the Magic comeback. "That is what we have been doing on the road, making big stops," Turkoglu said of Orlando, now 8-2 in road games. The Magic's 3-point shooting helped counter an off night by leading scorer  Dwight Howard , who had 14 points and tied a season low with seven rebounds. The stunning comeback spoiled brilliant performances by Roy and Aldridge. Roy scored 20 of his 30 points in the second half, to go along with a season-high nine rebounds. Aldridge, who hit 12 of 17 shots, had 25 points and 13 rebounds. Reserve  Joel Przybilla  added 11 points and 11 rebounds. The loss was Portland's first at home this season. The Blazers fell into a first-place tie with Denver in the Northwest Division. "Our offense was really bad the last minute and a half," Roy said. "It's a tough loss but tomorrow's a new day." Game notes  Portland guard  Martell Webster  will be out approximately four weeks because of a recurring problem with a stress fracture in his left foot. Webster, who missed the season's first 21 games, returned to action Sunday against Toronto. The Blazers say Webster is experiencing pain in his little toe joint. ... Portland played at home for just the eighth time this season, tied with Golden State for fewest in the NBA. ... Howard was held to a season-low seven rebounds. He had consecutive 20-point, 20-rebound games coming into Tuesday's contest. ... Portland travels to Utah on Thursday, then plays 10 of its next 12 at home.
