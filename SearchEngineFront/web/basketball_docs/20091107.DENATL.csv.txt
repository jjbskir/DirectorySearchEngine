The Hawks were coming off a 103-83 loss to Charlotte on Friday night. "It's a big statement. Having a letdown loss last night, and being able to come in and beat the number two or three team last year in the Western Conference. That's a big boost of confidence," said Smith, 8 of 10 from the field and 6 of 8 from the line. "I had opportunities to succeed and I seized the moment. I have wonderful guys to pass the ball to and I was really looking to crash the boards." The Hawks had a season-high 125 points and 30 assists.
