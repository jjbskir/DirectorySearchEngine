 Despite missing 13 of his first 14 shots and 16 of 23 overall, the seven-foot forward hit a turnaround 17-foot jumper over  Reggie Evans  at the buzzer to give the  Dallas Mavericks  a 95-93 victory against Philadelphia, snapping the 76ers' season-high seven-game winning streak. "I'm a shooter," Nowitzki said. "I always think the next one is going in." Nowitzki received the inbounds pass with 4.3 seconds left and spun around the 6-foot-8 Evans to deliver the game-winning shot. "It's easy to get it to him because he's seven feet," Kidd said of Nowitzki. "He's done it all year. He's an All-Star and an MVP and he enjoys these moments." Nowitzki finished with 24 points,  Jason Kidd  had 22 points and 12 rebounds and  Jason Terry  added 20 for the Mavericks (24-17). Philadelphia coach Tony DiLeo didn't second-guess his decision to put the smaller Evans on Nowitzki. "Reggie had a good feel for him because he was guarding him for the last five minutes as we were making our comeback," DiLeo said. "Reggie is a physical guy who did push him out and contested the shot." Lou Williams  scored 25 points, while  Andre Iguodala  had 18 points and 12 rebounds for the 76ers (20-21), who are trying to climb above .500 for the first time since Nov. 23 when they were 7-6. Andre Miller  added 12 points for Philadelphia, whose four-game home winning streak ended. "I was proud of the way we came back," Iguodala said. "I think we need to continue to have that hunger." The 76ers have reason to be optimistic with the expected return of forward  Elton Brand , who worked out on the court before the game. DiLeo said Brand, who dislocated his right shoulder Dec. 17 and has missed 16 consecutive games, most likely will play Saturday against the  New York Knicks . Dallas overcame an early deficit and was sparked by Kidd and Nowitzki. Kidd tied his season-high with six 3-pointers, while Nowitzki shook off a poor shooting performance from the field (7-of-23) by hitting all 10 of his free throws. Nowitzki is 44-for-45 from the free throw line over the last six games. Kidd was 6-of-8 from 3-point territory. "They're going to give me 3-point shots," Kidd said. "I haven't been making many, but I've been staying with it." Dallas trailed 55-47 with 8:58 remaining in the third quarter, then went on a 19-4 run over six minutes. Kidd scored 11 points, including three 3-pointers, and Nowitzki had eight during the scoring spurt to give the Mavericks a 66-59 advantage. By the end of the third quarter, the Mavericks led 74-63, with Kidd and Nowitzki combining for 25 of their 32 points. With 2:14 remaining, Terry hit a 3-pointer from the baseline to give Dallas a 93-81 lead. It wouldn't last as the 76ers scored 12 straight points, tying the game at 93 with 8.5 seconds left after a driving layup by Iguodala. "We really came back there at the end," DiLeo said. "They never gave up. That's the essence of our team." Game notes  There were several tributes to Martin Luther King Jr. on the jumbotron throughout the game, and 76ers G  Willie Green  addressed the crowd before the game. Mavericks F  Josh Howard , listed as doubtful with a sprained left wrist, played 34 minutes. Mavericks G  Matt Carroll  and C  Ryan Hollins  were active for the first time in a Dallas uniform. They were traded from Charlotte last Friday for C  DeSagana Diop .
