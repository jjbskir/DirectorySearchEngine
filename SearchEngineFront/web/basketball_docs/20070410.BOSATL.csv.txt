ATLANTA -- Coach Mike Woodson wishes  Tyronn Lue  could've
played this season without nagging injuries. 	   A strained groin and a sore left hamstring cost Lue 24 games
during the  Atlanta Hawks ' third straight losing season under
Woodson.
 Elias Says  The Hawks made 41 of 68 shots against the Celtics on Tuesday, 60.3 percent. The Hawks have shot 60 percent or better from the floor in only one other game over the last nine seasons; they were 43 of 68, 63.2 percent, against the Knicks on Dec. 16, 2005.

said. "He's getting his legs back under him after being out so
long." 	   Lue scored 26 points with 10 assists, and  Zaza Pachulia  had 22
points and 12 rebounds to help Atlanta beat the  Boston Celtics 
104-96 on Tuesday night. 	    Gerald Green 's career-high 33 points led Boston, which has lost
five straight on the road and 16 of 19. Overall, the Celtics have a
four-game losing streak. 	   A poor fourth quarter doused Green's mood after he went just
2-of-7 from the field. 	   "I needed to get fouled or score," Green said. "I was
settling for jumpers when I should have been a little more
aggressive in going to the hole." 	   The Hawks, who had dropped eight of nine, were without their top
three leading scorers after  Josh Smith  earned a two-game suspension
for arguing with Woodson in an overtime loss at Philadelphia on
Sunday. 	   Atlanta shot a season-best 60.3 percent from the field. In the
fourth, the Hawks were 11-of-15, with Lue going 5-of-5. 	   Lue had eight straight points during the midway stretch of the
fourth quarter and ended the scoring for Atlanta with a 3-pointer
that matched the Hawks' biggest lead at 11. 	   "This definitely feels good," Lue said. "The team had
confidence in me to make big shots. I was able to get some open
looks." 	   Boston also didn't have its top three scorers as  Paul Pierce , Al
Jefferson and  Wally Szczerbiak  all missed the game with injuries. 	   Green hit a 3-pointer at the 4:55 mark of the second quarter to
match Boston's biggest lead at 13, but Pachulia's 16-footer ended a
28-14 run to give the Hawks a 64-63 lead with 8:07 left in the
third. 	   "We got something out of this, but obviously we didn't get a
win out of it," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. "We were trying to
get something out of Gerald Green. We basically made him our go-to
guy tonight." 	    Leon Powe  had 19 points and  Rajon Rondo  16 as the Celtics fell
to 23-54, worst in the Eastern Conference. 	   "In the first half, we came out aggressive and got fast breaks,
but they came out in the second half and did the same thing to
us," Rondo said. "Down the stretch, they executed better, but
games like this build confidence for young guys, including
myself." 	    Marvin Williams  scored 21 points for Atlanta, which has the
third-worst record in the East at 29-49. 	   "I think the guys came together, and we were able to put
together some stops on the defensive end," Williams said. "Guys
like Tyronn and Royal (Ivey) came in and made big shots. I think
everybody is stepping up to play. With Tyronn out there, he's
always going to be a leader, but I feel like I can help out a
little bit, too."
