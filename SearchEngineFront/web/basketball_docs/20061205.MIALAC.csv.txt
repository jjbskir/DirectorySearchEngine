LOS ANGELES (AP) --  Elton Brand  had 33 points and 17 rebounds to
lead the  Los Angeles Clippers  to a 101-97 victory over the Miami
Heat on Tuesday night. Brand scored six points during a 19-6 run in the first six
minutes of the second half as the Clippers pulled out to a 68-54
lead and they stayed in front -- barely -- the rest of the way. Brand had to hit another shot, an 11-footer that made it 94-91
with 51 seconds remaining after Dwyane Wade's four consecutive free
throws cut the lead to one point. Wade missed a layup with 41
seconds left, and Brand was there to get the rebound. Alonzo Mourning  fouled him, and Brand made both free throws. The
Clippers went on to hit 7-of-8 from the line in the final 41
seconds. The double-double was the ninth of the season for Brand, who
went 13-of-18 from the floor.  Cuttino Mobley  added 21 points for
Los Angeles, and  Shaun Livingston  had 11 points and seven assists. Wade led the Heat with 33 points, Mourning had 16 points and 11
rebounds, and  Udonis Haslem  had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Heat went just 3-of-25 from 3-point range, while the
Clippers also made three, but in just 10 tries. Miami was coming off consecutive victories and trying to win
three in a row on the road for the first time since Feb. 15-March
19, when they won six straight. The Heat are 3-6 at home, 4-4 on the road. Los Angeles has had
reverse fortunes, with a 9-2 home record and 0-6 mark on the road. The Clippers overcame a five-point deficit in the final 2:37 of
the second quarter to take a 45-44 lead into halftime. Brand had 13
points, nine rebounds and two assists in the first half. Wade had 15 by halftime, but took just three shots in the second
quarter and had three points. Miami stayed close despite shooting 38 percent from the floor to
the Clippers' 49 percent in the half. The Heat's percentage was low
because they made only one of their 14 shots from 3-point range,
that by Wade on one of his three shots from behind the arc in the
first two quarters. Wade scored 10 in the opening period, and Miami led 25-22.
Livingston was the leading scorer for Los Angeles, with six
points. Game notes Heat G  Gary Payton , who missed Saturday's 98-97 victory at
Memphis with an ear infection, scored seven points against Los
Angeles but was 0-for-5 in 3-point tries. ... Miami C Shaquille
