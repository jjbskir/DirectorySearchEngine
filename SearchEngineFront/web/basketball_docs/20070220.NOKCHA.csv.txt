CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Raymond Felton  and  Chris Paul  insist
there is no added incentive to perform when they face each other.
 

   Their teammates disagree.
 

   Felton had 21 points and 11 assists and outplayed Paul in a
matchup of second-year point guards to lead the  Charlotte Bobcats 
to a 104-100 win over the New Orleans Hornets on Tuesday night.
 

   "They're very competitive and they're very good friends, so I
think when they play, both of them are on their toes," Bobcats
forward  Gerald Wallace  said. "They're trying to be aggressive and
it made for an exciting game tonight."
 

   Felton, the fifth pick in the 2005 draft and former North
Carolina star, scored nine points in the fourth quarter when the
Bobcats pulled away in a bruising game that included a shoving
match and five technical fouls.
 

   Paul, the fourth pick in the draft and a former college rival of
Felton when he played at Wake Forest, had 20 points and seven
assists, but the Hornets lost for only the fourth time in 13 games.
 

   "We're very good friends, but at the same time he's just like
any other point guard in the league," Paul said.
 

   Teammate  Tyson Chandler  isn't so sure.
 

   "I'm sure playing against any of the good point guards in the
league, he's always going to go at them and try to improve his
ranking in the league," Chandler said.
 

   The Hornets led by one going into the fourth quarter, when
Felton scored five quick points to put the Bobcats ahead. Matt
Carroll's 3-pointer with just under 6 minutes left made it 89-84.
 

   Just over a minute later, Felton blew by Paul and fed Wallace
for a layup to complete a 7-0 run and put Charlotte ahead 98-90.
 

    Jannero Pargo 's 3-pointer with 31 seconds left cut the lead to
102-100, but  Derek Anderson , in his first game back from an ankle
injury, hit two free throws with 6 seconds left to put it away.
 

   Wallace had 21 points and  Emeka Okafor  added 16 points and 15
rebounds for the Bobcats, who won their second straight game.
 

   "We're starting to learn how to finish games now," Felton
said. "If that was us last year, we probably wouldn't have pulled
that out."
 

    Desmond Mason  scored 17 points,  David West  scored 16 and
Chandler had 16 points and 20 rebounds for the Hornets, who lost
despite a 47-36 rebounding edge.
 

   It marked the third time the Hornets have returned to Charlotte
since they left for New Orleans in 2002 after a bitter dispute over
a new arena. With a complete turnover of the roster and coaching
staff, only a handful of support staff members and broadcasters
remain from the Charlotte team. And there was little buzz in the
crowd until a mini-skirmish midway through the third quarter.
 

    Jake Voskuhl  fouled Paul on a drive to the basket and kept
Paul's arm pinned to his side. Paul lunged at Voskuhl, then reached
around and threw the ball at Voskuhl's shoulder. Chandler came over
and pushed Voskuhl, and then Mason and Wallace started shoving.
 Adam Morrison  and West ran into the scrum before the officials
separated everyone.
 

   Paul, West, Voskuhl, Wallace and Morrison were all called for
technical fouls, but no one was ejected.
 

   A minute later, Wallace set a blind pick on Paul at midcourt,
knocking him to the floor _ and the rest of the game had
playoff-like intensity.
 

   "They won the game, so I say it brought their emotion and their
intensity up more than ours," Hornets coach Byron Scott said. "We
don't have the killer instinct, period. We're comfortable at home,
but on the road we're not a very good team right now."
 

   New Orleans fell to 8-18 on the road.
 

   The Bobcats' injury problems continued to grow as  Jeff McInnis ,
who sprained his right ankle in practice Monday, joined Brevin
Knight (groin),  Sean May  (knee) and  Othella Harrington  (knee) in
street clothes.
 
 Game notes Bobcats coach and general manager Bernie Bickerstaff said
he wasn't upset that part-owner  Michael Jordan  did not mention him
in a letter to fans sent out this week. "I hadn't thought about
that. It certainly didn't offend me," said Bickerstaff, whose
status for next season is uncertain. ... Paul, from nearby
Winston-Salem, bought 350 tickets for friends and family members.
... Hornets F  Peja Stojakovic , out since undergoing back surgery in
November, did some light shooting and running before the game. He
still hopes to return by the end of the season.
