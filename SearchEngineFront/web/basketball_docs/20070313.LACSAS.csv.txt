SAN ANTONIO -- If the  San Antonio Spurs  were the forgotten team in the Western Conference race earlier this season, there is no overlooking them now. The Spurs won their 13th straight Tuesday night, beating the  Los Angeles Clippers  93-84. They haven't lost since Feb. 11. "Thirteen games ago, we didn't say we needed to win 13 in a row to get back into this thing," said  Tim Duncan . "We're just trying to get better as a basketball team, so when the playoffs start, we feel we can win games night in and night out." With the  Dallas Mavericks ' 17-game winning streak ending with a 117-100 loss Monday to the  Golden State Warriors , San Antonio now owns the league's longest winning streak and its longest of the season. "It would mean more if we won 14," Duncan said. "And if we win 14, then 15. You just want to win the next one. That's what it's about." Tony Parker  led the Spurs with 25 points. Duncan added 19,  Manu Ginobili  had 16 and  Michael Finley  contributed 13 as the Spurs completed a sweep of their four meetings with the Clippers this season. Corey Maggette  led the Clippers with 17 points, while  Elton Brand  had 16 points and 10 rebounds.  Tim Thomas  had 15 points,  Chris Kaman  added 13 and  Jason Hart  contributed 10. The Spurs' 46-18 record puts them 3 1/2 games behind the  Phoenix Suns , who have won five in a row, for second place in the Western Conference. "We're not looking at the standings yet," Duncan said. "It will figure itself out. We're just worried about ourselves right now. Just trying to play our best basketball." Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said his team made little progress Tuesday and wasted a chance to improve. "It wasn't the greatest game but we came out with the win," he said. "Winning is always more fun than losing." The Clippers have lost four straight, including an 88-74 loss to San Antonio in Los Angeles on March 5. "I thought we missed a lot of good shots," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "We had a lot of great shots that we just didn't finish. We had a lot of in-and-outs around the basket." The Clippers went just 3-of-7 from the foul line and gave up 22 points off of 13 turnovers. "You make any type of mistake, even the smallest kind of mistake, they capitalize on them," Maggette said. Los Angeles had a one-point lead after one quarter thanks to Hart, who was 4-of-4 from the field in the period. Duncan scored 10 of his 14 first-half points in the second, and Parker added six points in the last 1:11, including a running layup with 6.8 seconds left that gave the Spurs a 50-40 halftime lead. "What gives us hope is the fact that if we play like we did tonight we will win games," Dunleavy said. Maggette scored six straight Los Angeles points early in the third and had 10 in the quarter. Finley had eight for San Antonio, which extended its lead to 11 after three. The Clippers got within five early in the fourth before Parker helped the Spurs pull away.  Brent Barry 's steal led to Parker' layup with 5:33 left to make it 84-75. Parker added two more buckets to push the lead to 88-78.
