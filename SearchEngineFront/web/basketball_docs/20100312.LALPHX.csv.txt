 The Suns rallied from 15 down in the second half and led briefly early in the fourth quarter before the Lakers pulled ahead for good. "We played with a lot of poise," Bryant said. "They got back into it but we never really got rattled. We just had to execute and take what the defense gives us." Los Angeles had lost three of four overall and four in a row on the road. "At some point we have to step it up," the Lakers'  Pau Gasol  said. "I think it was a perfect opportunity for us tonight to step it up and play a good game and have a nice win and get ourselves going, because we have been kind of struggling for the most part, especially on the road." Phoenix coach Alvin Gentry was ejected by referee Mike Callahan and had to be restrained by his assistant coaches before leaving the court with 5:06 to play. Gentry thought Gasol should have been called for a flagrant foul on Lou Amundson's drive to the basket with 5:06 to play. Andrew Bynum  added 18 points for the Lakers, while Gasol,  Ron Artest  and  Derek Fisher  scored 15 apiece. "Kobe kind of messed up his hand a little bit again. He was reluctant to shoot," Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. "He got the ball to guys wide open, made the defense collapse. They shared the ball pretty well." Amare Stoudemire  had 29 points and 16 rebounds for the Suns, playing for the first time in six days. Phoenix was without  Channing Frye , suspended for his part in an altercation against the  Indiana Pacers  the last time the Suns played. Gentry didn't want to talk about the ejection, just his second since he took over as coach after last season's All-Star break. Amundson didn't think the play was any big deal. "It was a hard foul but I don't think he's a dirty player or anything," Amundson said. "I think he was just trying to make a play on the ball. It was really physical all night, so I wasn't surprised." Bryant liked the play. "Pau gave a hard foul tonight, which is what we like to see from him," Bryant said. "We don't like giving up layups or giving up easy opportunities. We're just playing hard. It's not playing dirty. It's just not giving up anything easy." Bryant banged his previously injured finger when Stoudemire blocked his dunk attempt in the third quarter. "I can't hold the ball, so that's a little frustrating," Bryant said. "But it feels OK now." The Lakers fell behind early, used a stifling defense to take control in the second quarter and built a 15-point lead in the third. The Suns came back to lead 82-81 after Amundson's third dunk in the opening 2:50 of the fourth quarter. But  Shannon Brown  responded with a dunk over Amundson, triggering a decisive 12-1 run. Fisher's two free throws on the two technicals against Gentry put Los Angeles ahead 93-83 with 5:06 remaining. Phoenix managed cut it to 100-96 on Stoudemire's dunk with 1:26 to play. Amundson blocked  Lamar Odom 's shot at the other end, but  Steve Nash  threw the ball away. Bryant finished off the scoring by making two of four free throws. Stoudemire had 17 points and eight rebounds in the first quarter, when the Suns led by as many nine. The Lakers, though, outscored Phoenix 21-9 over the last seven minutes of the first half to lead 53-46 at the break. The Suns shot 22 percent (5 of 23) in the second quarter. "I think the second quarter is was what got us," Stoudemire said. "We didn't score particularly well there. The Lakers took advantage of it."
