 Bryant shot only 8-of-23, but the Lakers overwhelmed Phoenix with their depth. Six players reached double figures as Los Angeles improved its record to a league-best 9-1. "I was telling Luke [Walton] about 10 minutes ago that this might be the first season I average 31 minutes because we've been blowing people out," Bryant said. "I've been sitting the whole fourth quarter. That's pretty amazing." Bryant did make a fourth-quarter cameo, but mostly it was left to the reserves to finish off Phoenix. Radmanovic scored 15,  Lamar Odom  13,  Jordan Farmar  11, and  Andrew Bynum  and  Trevor Ariza  10 apiece for Los Angeles.  Pau Gasol  scored only four points but had nine assists and nine rebounds. "They're the best team," the Suns'  Shaquille O'Neal  said. "They're 9-1. They're playing good. Kobe's playing team ball, keeping everybody involved. He's got a lot of shooters around him. They're a very dangerous team." Amare Stoudemire scored 21 for Phoenix on 9-for-21 shooting. The Lakers' reserves outscored their Suns counterparts 42-30. "It's the kind of game we need from our bench," Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson said. "We were able to play them most of the fourth quarter." The Lakers had 21 points off 15 Phoenix turnovers. Los Angeles committed just seven turnovers, resulting in seven points for the Suns. Radmanovic had only five points and was 0-for-2 on 3s in the Lakers' victory over Chicago on Tuesday night. "We'd been kidding him that he'd not made a shot the last week," Jackson said. O'Neal added 15 points and nine rebounds against a team he helped win three NBA titles. The Suns'  Steve Nash  was scoreless in the first half and finished with eight points and 10 assists, leaving the court with back spasms with 4:38 to play. "I thought Raja [Bell] did a great job on Kobe," Phoenix coach  Terry Porter  said. "He goes 8-for-23 and he has other guys step up. That's what's made these guys good this year." The Lakers made 10 of 21 3-pointers to win in Phoenix for the third straight time. Los Angeles took the lead for good late in the first half. The Lakers led by 14 in the third quarter and were up 89-71 when Odom sank a 3-pointer with 8:34 to play. Phoenix cut the lead to 10 in the final few minutes but got no closer. The Lakers went on a 14-0 run to end the first quarter and start the second, taking a 32-24 lead on Bynum's 10-footer. The Suns responded with a 12-2 spurt to go up 37-34 when  Grant Hill  made one of two free throws with 7:05 left in the half. Los Angeles, though, outscored Phoenix 17-7 the rest of the quarter to lead 51-44 at the break. The Lakers padded the lead in the opening minutes of the second half. Bryant's fast-break basket made it 63-51 with 7:47 left in the third quarter. The Suns twice cut it to eight before back-to-back 3-pointers by Radmanovic and  Derek Fisher  gave Los Angeles a 76-62 with 2:21 left in the third. The Lakers led 80-67 entering the fourth.
