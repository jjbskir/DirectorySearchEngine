PHILADELPHIA (AP) --  Chris Bosh  has been shooting at least 100 free throws every day in practice. The extra work is paying off. Bosh made 16-of-18 free throws, scored 24 points and had 10 rebounds to help the  Toronto Raptors  snap a three-game losing streak with a 105-103 victory over the  Philadelphia 76ers  on Friday. Bosh is 48-of-52 from the line in six games, while going 26-of-66 from the field. "My percentage from the field isn't good right now," Bosh said. "If I'm wide open, I'm going to take the jump shot. If not, I'll go to the basket and try and draw the foul. I have confidence in my free-throw shooting." Anthony Parker  added 22 points, including a 3-pointer with 33.7 seconds remaining.  T.J. Ford  had 16 for the Raptors. Raptors coach  Sam Mitchell  said it was a confidence boost to simply win the game. "Every night is a grind," he said. "There are no easy wins." Andre Iguodala  scored 17 of his 26 points in the second half, and  Lou Williams  scored 19 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter for the Sixers. Williams' 3-pointer with 55.2 seconds remaining pulled the Sixers to 98-96. But Parker came right back with a clutch 3-pointer of his own for a 101-96 advantage. "It's good to see the ball go through the hoop," Parker said. "Defensively, I felt like we did a good job, forcing them to take some tough shots, which they hit." On the Sixers' next possession, Williams hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Parker. Williams connected on the free throw for a rare four-point play, cutting Toronto's lead to 101-100 with 21.4 seconds left. "I was watching some old high school tape of myself and I noticed I was going to the basket," Williams said. "I just tried to do that in this game and take what was open." Two free throws by Bosh gave Toronto a 103-100 lead before Williams had the opportunity for a three-point play with 15.2 seconds left, but he missed the free throw. With Philadelphia down 105-102, Iguodala went to the line with 1.8 seconds left. He missed the first shot and attempted to misfire on the second only to send the ball through the hoop. "We don't have a lot of room for error," Iguodala said. "We have to box out and get our hands on loose balls." Williams carried the Sixers in the fourth quarter, scoring 10 points in the first 5:35. His jumper with 5:25 left tied the game at 87. The Sixers made it 92-91 on a basket by Iguodala with 3:52 to go, but Bosh responded with five straight points -- two free throws and a layup -- for a 96-91 lead. Game notes  Mitchell made a change in his starting lineup, replacing  Andrea Bargnani  with  Rasho Nesterovic . "We're not panicking because we're 2-3," Mitchell said before the game. "We're just trying to get the most out of the guys." ... Moon hit his first career field goal in the second quarter ... The Raptors connected on their first 17 free throws ...
