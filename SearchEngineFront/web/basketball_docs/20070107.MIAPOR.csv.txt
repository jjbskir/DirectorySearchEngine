PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Although  Dwyane Wade  said he was sluggish
after his four-game layoff, he didn't really show it. Wade returned from a wrist injury and scored 33 points to lead
the  Miami Heat  to a 93-90 victory Sunday night over the Portland
Trail Blazers. Wade, who had 25 points in the first half, helped Miami rally
from a 16-point deficit and snap a five-game losing streak. "It was good to come out and give my teammates some confidence
and pull out a win," he said. The Heat closed to 81-79 on Wade's dunk, before  Jason Kapono  hit
a 3-pointer that gave Miami its first lead of the second half,
82-81. Zach Randolph 's jumper with 2:19 left gave the Blazers the lead
back, but after a Portland free throw, Kapono again hit a 3-pointer
to make it 85-84 for Miami. Randolph hit another jumper, but  Alonzo Mourning  answered with a
hook shot and Wade dunked to make it 89-86. Rookie  LaMarcus Aldridge 's jumper got the Blazers closer with 23
seconds left before Wade made a pair of free throws.  Ime Udoka  made
a layup for the Blazers with 8.6 seconds left. Wade made another pair of free throws for the final margin.
 Brandon Roy 's 3-point attempt for the Blazers at the buzzer fell
short. Roy led the Blazers with 18 points. "They already knew the play. They read it," Roy shrugged. Wade, who was the league's fourth-leading scorer, hadn't played
since getting knocked out of a loss at Chicago on Dec. 27. "I could tell I was off for 10 days. I got a little tired," he
said. The Heat are still without  Shaquille O'Neal ,  Antoine Walker  and
 James Posey . Before Miami coach Pat Riley took a leave of absence
earlier this week and had knee surgery, he deactivated Walker and
Posey after they missed their body-fat requirements by 1 percent. Riley said that if Walker and Posey don't meet the requirements
by Jan. 15, they could be suspended. Ron Rothstein is filling in as the Miami coach. The Blazers went up 30-22 on  Martell Webster 's 3-pointer as the
first quarter drew to a close and led by as many as 14 points in
the first half. The Heat closed to 56-52 on Wade's long jumper, but Portland
went on to a 60-52 halftime lead. The Blazers extended their lead to 73-59 on  Jarrett Jack 's
3-pointer in the third quarter. After 60 points in the first half, the Blazers got only 30 in
the second, and 13 points in the fourth quarter. Surprisingly, Randolph was hardly a factor at all. The team's
top scorer and rebounder had just six points and no rebounds after
the first half. He finished with 15 points and three boards. Kapono had 19 points for Miami, 10 in the fourth quarter. "I told him at the end of the third quarter that I wanted him
to be aggressive, like he was when I was out," Wade said. "He's
one of the best shooters there is in the NBA." The Blazers were without forward  Travis Outlaw , who missed his
second straight game with a sprained ankle. Portland was coming off a 110-105 overtime win at Sacramento the
night before that snapped a four-game losing streak. Wade, who played 41 minutes, made 15 of 17 free throws. "Dwyane Wade, of course, was the big difference," Blazers
coach Nate McMillan said. "Not only is he hard to defend, but he
gets to the free throw line." Joked Rothstein: "That Wade kid, I think we'll keep him." Game notes The Heat swept the Blazers in two games last season. ...
Heat center  Michael Doleac  went to Portland's Central Catholic High
School. Guard  Gary Payton  went to Oregon State. ... Wade was handed
a technical for delay of game in the first half. He argued the call
to no avail.
