SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs didn't need the return of  Manu Ginobili  to sail past the  Golden State Warriors  on Monday night. Ginobili came off the bench and played 16 minutes in his first
action since Nov. 24, having missed the last four games with a
lower back contusion. He had six points and nine assists in fewer
than 16 minutes, but San Antonio hardly needed it in a 129-89
blowout of the Golden State Warriors. "I couldn't go to the basket so hard. I was a little scared,"
Ginobili said, though he added that he felt "100 percent." Ginobili came off the bench with just under three minutes left
in the first and within 40 seconds had two assists to Francisco
Elson, then another to Udrih with a minute to go in the period. Ginobili could afford another night of rest. The Spurs reserves
scored 75 points and San Antonio scored a season-high 129 points,
the most it has scored in a regulation game since a 131-111 win at
home against Denver on April 22, 1993. The last time the Spurs won by at least 40 points was a 109-67
win over Sacramento on Jan. 10, 1998 at home. "We got them mad as hornets the last time we beat them and then
they haven't played very well at home," said Warriors coach Don
Nelson. "I mean, I knew we were going into a hornets' nest. And
you were just hoping that we could just kind of hang around but no,
not tonight, we just totally got dominated." Anthony Roberson , who had sprained his left thumb Saturday
against the  Milwaukee Bucks , scored 21 for Golden State. He was
followed by  Mike Dunleavy  and  Monta Ellis , who had 12 and 11,
respectively. "I think everyone had a more concentrated effort. We were
trying to accomplish the little things tonight," said  Bruce Bowen ,
who had seven points. San Antonio had a season high 37 assists and sank a season high
49 field goals. Eight Spurs players, led by  Brent Barry  with 18, scored in the
double digits. Beno Udrih  had a season-high 16 points, including two 3-pointers
in a row about five minutes into the fourth quarter. He had three
3-pointers in the game and played 24 minutes with the Spurs up big. Tony Parker  and  Michael Finley  had 14 points each.  Tim Duncan 
had 15 points and eight boards. After leading by as much as 20 in the first, the Spurs took a
16-point cushion into the second period. Golden State never had the lead. The Spurs took a 14-point
advantage into the second half. The Warriors couldn't catch San Antonio in the third as the
Spurs steadily extended their margin. The Spurs took a 93-61 lead
into the final period, where  Eric Williams  led the team with 10
points and Udrih contributed eight. "It wasn't a good night for us. We've got to bounce back,"
Roberson said. "Whether you win by a lot or a little bit, you come out tonight
and you're able to rest a little bit and you beat a team that's
beaten you in the regular season," Duncan said. "That's a good
win for us."
^Notes:@ Golden State G  Jason Richardson , the team's leading scorer
last season, was not with the team Saturday due to soreness in his
surgically repaired left knee. ... Golden State's 14 points in the
first period were its season low. It was also the fewest points
given up by the Spurs in an opening quarter this season.
