 Dallas was down 72-56 after Utah's  Wes Matthews  hit a layup with 9:51 left. The Mavericks later trailed by 13 before Nowitzki's three-point play triggered a 19-6 run capped by his layup with 2:41 remaining to tie it at 83. Nowitzki's short jumper on Dallas' next possession put the Mavericks in front for good, 85-83 with 2:05 left. Carlos Boozer 's basket with 3:49 to play had given the Jazz an 83-78 edge, but Utah wouldn't score again until Boozer's dunk with 35 seconds remaining. Nowitzki left to a standing ovation with 28 seconds to play. After three quarters, the Mavericks managed 52 points and were shooting 32 percent from the floor. But in the final quarter, Nowitzki took an aggressive approach, driving to the basket on almost every possession. He went 7-for-8 from the field, hit all 14 free throws and pulled down five rebounds. "We just kept feeding him," Dallas'  Shawn Marion  said. "He had it going. He was unstoppable." The NBA record for points in a fourth quarter is Wilt Chamberlain's 31 for Philadelphia on March 2, 1962 against the  New York Knicks . The mark for points in any quarter is 33 shared by San Antonio's George Gervin (April 9, 1978) and Denver's  Carmelo Anthony  (Dec. 10, 2008). "Twenty-five years in this, I've seen a lot of amazing things happen," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. "To be honest, it wasn't looking great, but we just needed a couple good things to happen offensively for us." Deron Williams  scored 22 points and  Mehmet Okur  added 14 points and 14 rebounds for Utah (1-3). The Jazz lost its sixth straight in Dallas. Jason Kidd  had 19 points -- five on 3-pointers- for the Mavericks (3-1). Nowitzki did most of his fourth-quarter damage against Okur. Utah coach Jerry Sloan wanted to use the quicker Boozer to defend Nowitzki down the stretch, but Boozer was saddled with five fouls. "Obviously, there wasn't anything we were able to do with Nowitzki," Sloan said. "He was sensational. He made every basket and got to the free throw line, but the most important thing he did was he was able to take the ball to the basket." Nowitzki went 12-for-22 from the field, 15-for-16 from the foul line, and added 11 rebounds and five blocked shots. Dallas was able to follow up on victories over the Lakers and Clippers in a two-game weekend trip to Los Angeles with its first home win. Williams had 12 third-quarter points as the Jazz ended the quarter with a 22-6 spurt for a 67-52 lead before Utah's collapse down the stretch. "It's tough, because we were up by 15 with 8 minutes to go," Boozer said. "The next thing you know it was free throw, free throw, free throw, free throw." Utah was up 37-35 after a tough first half for both offenses. The Jazz shot 34 percent from the field and the Mavericks hit 32 percent in the opening 24 minutes.
