TORONTO -- The  Toronto Raptors  were determined to rebound from a disappointing loss against one Eastern Conference playoff team with a victory against another. Chris Bosh  had 23 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Raptors to a 110-88 rout over the  Indiana Pacers  on Friday night. Jorge Garbajosa  added 16 points for the Raptors, who allowed Wednesday's game against Cleveland to slip away. The Raptors never trailed against Indiana and their biggest lead was 27 points. "We wanted to come out and make a statement. We definitely allowed one to get away from us the other night against Cleveland," point guard  T.J. Ford . "We're competing to get top spot in the East and we think we're capable of doing it." Toronto has won nine of its past 10 at home. The Raptors shot 56 percent and held the Pacers to 39 percent. Bosh finished 8-for-12 from the field. The first-time All-Star starter blamed himself for Wednesday's loss after failing to box out Cleveland's  Anderson Varejao , who dunked over Bosh with 16 seconds left for the final points of the game. Fans chanted 'MVP! MVP!' as Bosh made late free throws against the Pacers. "We noticed that we weren't moving the ball the last game. We wanted to make a point of sharing the ball," Bosh said. "Guys stepped up and knocked down open shots." Jamaal Tinsley  had 19 points for the Pacers, who fell a half-game behind Toronto in the East.  Darrell Armstrong  made a 59-foot heave at the buzzer before halftime for Indiana's only highlight. "We were on our heels from the beginning of the game," Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. "They played with a lot of aggression and we just were a step behind most of the night." Garbajosa's 3-pointer gave Toronto a 27-point lead late in the third quarter, but the Pacers began the fourth quarter on a 18-1 run capped by Armstrong's two 3-pointers and  Maceo Baston 's layup. But  Andrea Bargnani  followed with a 3-pointer to give Toronto a 13-point lead with 6:30 left. Toronto went 13-for-20 from beyond the arc. Ford and  Jose Calderon , Toronto's two point guards, combined for 17 points and 20 assists. Indiana struggled in the first quarter again, allowing Toronto to start the game on a 10-2 run led by Bosh's six points. Bargnani and Calderon each had eight points as Toronto outscored Indiana 40-29 in the second quarter. "We played hungry tonight," Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said.
