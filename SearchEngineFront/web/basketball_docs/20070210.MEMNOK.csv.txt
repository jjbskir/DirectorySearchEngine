OKLAHOMA CITY -- After needing extra time to get their last two wins,  Chris Paul  and the New Orleans Hornets disposed of their latest foe a little bit earlier. Elias Says The Grizzlies' loss makes them 0-15 in the second of back-to-back games in 2006-07. Over the last ten seasons only two other teams had streaks that length or longer within one season: the Bulls, who lost 20 such games to start the 2000-01 season, and the Celtics, who lost 17 straight during 1999-2000.

Paul had 23 points and 11 assists,  David West  added 22 points and the two teamed up to lead an early third-quarter surge as the Hornets pulled away for a 114-99 win over the  Memphis Grizzlies  on Saturday night. On the heels of consecutive overtime wins, New Orleans used a 17-3 push shortly after halftime to take control. West had three straight baskets to start the run, and  Devin Brown  finished it by blocking a 3-pointer by Memphis'  Mike Miller  and rushing to the other end for a layup that made it 75-54. "I think that's been one of the things that we've struggled with, not just this year but last year as well. We come out with a lead in the third, and then let a team back into it and make a game of it," said West, who shot 11-of-14. "We just wanted to come out with a lot of energy, and we did it." West had four baskets and one assist in the run, and Paul added a 3-pointer and four assists. The two combined for 20 points and seven assists in the third quarter. "It was a great third quarter for us. I think that's what really put the game away for us," Paul said. "We came out aggressively defensively, and we were able to execute everything offensively." Memphis used a 14-5 run to get within 102-91 on a pair of free throws by Tarence Kinsey with 4:34 remaining, moments after Hornets coach Byron Scott put his starters back in. Paul hit two free throws and then set up a basket by  Tyson Chandler  that extended the lead to 110-95. Chandler ended up with 15 points and 16 rebounds for his seventh double-double in eight games.  Desmond Mason  added 16 points, and Brown and  Bobby Jackson  each scored 11. The Hornets, coming off an overtime win at Denver and a double-overtime win against Milwaukee, have never played three straight overtime games. Pau Gasol  led Memphis with 21 points and 11 rebounds, while  Hakim Warrick  and  Rudy Gay  each scored 14. The Grizzlies fell to 0-15 in the second game of back-to-back sets and 0-13 against Southwest Division foes. Memphis, which beat Minnesota in overtime Friday, hasn't won consecutive games this season. The Grizzlies finish their home-and-home series against the Hornets on Tuesday in Memphis. "We have to do a better job and be more physical," Gasol said. "It was just a layup drill for them. We just have to be tougher." Playing with a wrap on his right triceps, Paul notched his second straight double-double -- his first two since missing 17 games with a sprained right ankle. It was his most assists since returning Jan. 31. Paul also ended one Grizzlies comeback attempt by pulling up in transition and hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer over  Lawrence Roberts  to give New Orleans a 91-71 edge after three quarters. "We just wanted to come out with no letdowns," West said. "This is a dangerous basketball team." New Orleans scored the first six points and opened a 10-point advantage on Jackson's jumper from the right wing that made it 25-15. Memphis scored the final five points of the period, and Warrick's jumper in the key it at 34. The Hornets surged ahead again just before halftime with a 10-0 run sparked by back-to-back 3-pointers by Brown and Paul. Chandler's fast-break layup made it 56-45 in the final minute, and New Orleans' lead at the break was nine after Gasol hit two free throws with 0.5 seconds left. It was never closer than seven after that.
