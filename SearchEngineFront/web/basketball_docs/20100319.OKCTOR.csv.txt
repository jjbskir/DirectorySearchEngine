TORONTO --  Kevin Durant  and the  Oklahoma City Thunder  made quick work of the fading  Toronto Raptors . Durant scored 23 of his 31 points in the first half to lead the Thunder to their sixth victory in seven games, 115-89 over the Raptors on Friday night. Durant was 7 of 16 from the field and 17 of 18 from the free-throw line. "He's turned into a bona fide superstar in this league," Raptors coach Jay Triano said. "He finds ways to score. He's active. You take one thing away from him, he goes to another." Jeff Green  added 25 points, and  Russell Westbrook  had 11 points and 10 assists for the Thunder, fifth in the Western Conference at 42-25.

The Raptors, eighth in the Eastern Conference with 15 games left, are 2-10 in their last 12 games and 33-34 overall. "We didn't respond. We didn't impose our will," Bosh said. "We didn't resist them at all, and you can't do that, because this team is going to play hard and they're going to play their basketball." Durant scored 23 points in the first half to take a 71-44 lead. Oklahoma City stretched the advantage to 34 in the second half on Green's 3-pointer. The fans at Air Canada Centre stood and booed as the game ended. "Teams have tough nights," Durant said. "We've had our tough nights. It happens in our league. I think we came out with a lot of energy today." Game notes  Bosh had four of Toronto' 19 turnovers. ...  Kyle Weaver , recalled recently from Tulsa of the NBA Development League, had 12 points for Oklahoma City.
