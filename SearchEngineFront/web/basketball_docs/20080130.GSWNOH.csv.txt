NEW ORLEANS (AP) --  Baron Davis  heard boos every time he touched the ball, right up until he sent the crowd to the exits with a game-sealing 3-pointer. Stephen Jackson  scored 26 points, Davis added 23, and the  Golden State Warriors  beat New Orleans 116-103 Wednesday night to snap the Hornets' nine-game winning streak. "Nobody likes to get booed," Davis said. "It wasn't really motivation. It was kind of distracting, but at the same time you've just got deal with it. I expected it, so I just dealt with it." He did indeed. Davis, who starred for the Hornets during their first two-plus seasons in New Orleans before being traded to Golden State, finished with five 3-pointers and nine assists. 
Not bad for a guy who stayed at the hotel during the morning shootaround because he was feeling ill. At the same time, Davis has had his share of great games in New Orleans, where he still keeps a home in the city's historic Uptown neighborhood. "It was pretty loud when they were booing, but I heard some people cheering and it's good to see some familiar faces and people rooting me on, telling me they appreciate everything I've done for the community," Davis said. "I still come back in the summertime. I just don't let people know I'm here. I still do things in the community, help people that were torn apart from Hurricane Katrina. I still have close ties to this city. I love this city. I think it was a great city before Hurricane Katrina and it will continue to be a great city afterward." Chris Paul  had 28 points and 12 assists for New Orleans (32-13), which lost for only the third time in 20 games.  David West  had 24 points and 13 rebounds. Golden State's lead was only 92-88 early in the fourth quarter. Then  Monta Ellis ' driving layup ignited an 11-2 run that included Davis' 3-pointer and gave Golden State a 103-90 lead with 6:21 to go. New Orleans lost its shooting touch as the game wound down and Davis buried his final 3-pointer, which made it 114-95 with 3:21 left. "When they are hitting all those outside shots it's really hard to beat them and we never took them out of their comfort zone," said West, who made only two of his first 11 shots before scoring 17 points in the third quarter. Ellis finished with 16 points.  Matt Barnes  scored 17 and  Andris Biedrins  14 for Golden State (28-19), which played with sustained vigor after losing a night earlier in Houston. Four New Orleans players finished with double-doubles, but the Hornets, who were missing starting shooting guard  Morris Peterson  because of a virus, got only nine points from their reserves. Peja Stojakovic  had 20 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, while  Tyson Chandler  had 11 points and 14 rebounds. Al Harrington  scored 13 points for the Warriors. He and Jackson each hit three 3-pointers. New Orleans, which raced to the top of the Western Conference on the strength of its defense, couldn't do much to stop a Warriors team that settled for jump shots and made the most of them. Through three quarters, Golden State had 11 3-pointers and had scored only 34 of its 90 points inside. The Warriors wound up with 13 3s as a team and shot 52 percent overall. When Jackson hit a tough 19-foot fade in the fourth quarter, he looked at Davis and the two smiled widely as they trotted back to the defensive end. "When we have all our guys on one page and we're hitting shots like that it feels good because we know we're definitely hard to beat that way," said Jackson, who smiled widely at Davis. Good shooting and swarming defense gave Golden State the edge in the first half. The Warriors shot 52 percent through the opening two quarters and led by as much as eight in the first quarter when Ellis spun through the lane on the dribble and converted an off-balance layup. New Orleans, boosted during its previous nine victories by strong play from its bench, had to shorten its rotation with Peterson and fellow guard  Bobby Jackson  (right hamstring) missing the game. Rasual Butler 's 3-pointer accounted for the only points by a New Orleans reserve in the first half, during which the Hornets shot 42 percent. Paul played all but the final half-minute of the second quarter and kept the Hornets close with 23 first-half points, while Stojakovic added 13 points and gave the Hornets a brief 52-51 lead with a jumper late in the second quarter. Golden State, meanwhile, hit six 3-pointers in the first half, with Davis making the last at the second quarter buzzer to give the Warriors a 58-54 halftime lead.
