 Courtney Lee  contributed 18 points, Howard added 12 and  Rafer Alston  had 11 for the Magic (43-16), who rebounded from a disappointing 93-85 home loss to the  Detroit Pistons  on Friday. The Magic improved to 21-9 on the road, the third best record in the NBA. The Southeast Division-leading Magic hit 15 of their 3-pointers, outscored the Sixers 36-20 in the fourth quarter, and won all three games against Philadelphia for their first season sweep since the 1997-98 season. "We are a good offensive team," Turkoglu said. "The fourth-quarter rally, we were knocking them down. We kept shooting. We knew we would knock them down." Orlando hit 10 of its first 30 3-pointers before connecting on five of seven in the fourth quarter, quieting a season-high crowd of 19,703 at the Wachovia Center. "I thought it was one of our best wins of the year," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "We had some fight in us." Andre Miller  had 23 points, eight rebounds and seven assists,  Andre Iguodala  scored 22,  Willie Green  added 19 and  Thaddeus Young  had 18 for the Sixers, who fell back to .500 at 29-29. "I'm disappointed, but I have to tip my hat and give the Magic credit," Green said. "Still, I think we can play a lot better defensively." Orlando didn't take its first lead until midway through the fourth quarter and continued launching 3s the entire game. They attempted 21 by halftime, 30 after three quarters and wound up tying the franchise record of 37 set Jan. 13 at Sacramento. In that game, a 139-107 victory, the Magic also set an NBA record with 23 3-pointers converted. The Magic tied a Wachovia Center record with their 37 attempts in this one. Lewis was 5-of-8, Lee was 4-of-12 and Turkoglu hit 3-of-5 from 3-point land. "We didn't give up," Turkoglu said. "We decided to stick with it. We're glad our shots went down." Howard was in foul trouble most of the way and largely ineffective, despite also finishing with eight rebounds. He fouled out with 17.5 seconds remaining. The Magic trailed 85-75 with 8:34 left before an 11-0 run gave them an 86-85 lead with 6:25 left. Lee scored eight of the 11 points. Orlando led 99-95 with 2:05 left, but the Sixers tied it at 99 with Miller and  Theo Ratliff  hitting two free throws each. "I was confident we'd win even after the Magic went ahead," Young said. "We have to lock down better on the defensive end." Howard hit one of two free throws with 1:36 left for a 100-99 lead. Iguodala missed a fadeaway jumper with 21.1 seconds remaining and Turkoglu was fouled. He made both free throws for a 102-99 advantage, and Iguodala then made another free throw to get the Sixers within 102-100 after Howard's sixth foul. Turkoglu tossed the inbounds pass the length of the court to a wide-open  Marcin Gortat , who sealed the win with a thunderous dunk. "Sometimes, teams just have your number," Iguodala said.
