MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) --  Zach Randolph  scored 21 points, including
two free throws with 2.9 seconds left, to lead the Portland Trail
Blazers to an 85-79 victory over the  Memphis Grizzlies  on Wednesday
night. Randolph grabbed 11 rebounds for Portland, which ended a
six-game road trip -- its longest of the season --with three straight
wins. It was the Blazers' sixth road win of the season, matching
their total away from the Rose Garden last season. Memphis, which trailed by as many as 21 points in the game,
overtook Portland with 1:15 remaining when  Alexander Johnson  made
free throws to cap an 8-0 run that gave the Grizzlies a 79-78 lead. But  Ime Udoka 's 20-foot jumper with a minute left gave Portland
the lead for good. Udoka finished with 15 points for the Trail Blazers, while
 Jarrett Jack  and  Juan Dixon  both scored 11. Mike Miller  led Memphis with 20 points, while  Damon Stoudamire 
scored 15,  Chucky Atkins  14 and  Rudy Gay  12. Memphis had benefited early in the fourth quarter when Randolph
was on the bench with foul trouble. That allowed the Grizzlies to
get within four points on several occasions. Things were ragged for Memphis almost from the start as the
Grizzlies were shooting 25 percent early and Portland was building
a 13-point lead by shooting 59 percent in the first quarter. At one point, the Grizzlies called two timeouts late in the
first period after getting trapped in the backcourt then failing to
get the ball inbounds. They came out of the second timeout with a
play that led to an interception at midcourt which Portland
converted into an alley-oop dunk by  Travis Outlaw . Meanwhile, Memphis'  Hakim Warrick  rattled two tomahawk dunk
attempts off the rim for misses. Randolph had his double-double in the second quarter as the
Trail Blazers weathered a 12-2 run by Memphis and rebuilt the lead
to 21 before taking a 48-35 halftime lead. The Trail Blazers held a 64-57 lead entering the final period. Game notes NBA commissioner David Stern met with the media before the
game and discussed a range of topics from the return to leather
basketballs to the future of the Grizzlies' ownership. ...
Grizzlies All-Star F  Pau Gasol  remained on the inactive list, but
his return appears imminent. The 7-footer has increased practice
time, and while coach Mike Fratello said it's a day-to-day
evaluation, he could return for Friday's home game against Atlanta
or on Saturday at Miami. ... Grizzlies F  Stromile Swift  left the
game in the fourth quarter with a sprained left ankle and did not
return. ... Randolph has 14 double-doubles this season. ...
Portland leads the overall series 12-11. Memphis had entered the
game winning six of the last seven home games in the series.
