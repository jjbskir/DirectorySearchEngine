MINNEAPOLIS -- The losses keep piling up for the Boston
Celtics, one after another to bring them to one of the low points
in the proud franchise's championship-laden history.
 

   And the Celtics dipped even lower on Sunday, not just because
they lost their franchise-record 18th straight game, but because of
how they lost it and to whom.
 
 
 
 When Will It End? 
 
 
  
 
 The Celtics lost their 18th straight game Sunday. The good news in Boston? The NBA's all-time worst losing streak is still six games from being touched. Here are the league's top losing streaks:

 	    Ricky Davis ' jumper from the corner with 0.2 seconds remaining
lifted the  Minnesota Timberwolves  to a 109-107 victory, prolonging
the winter of discontent in Boston.
 

   Davis finished with 28 points,  Kevin Garnett  had 26 points, 11
rebounds and 10 assists and another former Celtic,  Mark Blount ,
added 20 points for the Wolves.
 

   "It is tough, the guys played so hard and deserve to win,"
said  Paul Pierce , who scored 29 points. "We did everything we
could. Down the stretch they made the last play.
 

   "You can feel it in the locker room, each loss definitely
hurts. These guys are going to keep playing hard. We just need to
get it out of our head."
 

   After hitting the shot in front of the Celtics bench, Davis
posed with his arm in the air, then got a bear hug from Blount to
add just a little extra sting.
 

   "It's special when you get traded together with a guy like
Mark," Davis said. "He feeds off me and I feed off him and it was
just a great feeling for us to beat them. Mark came over and gave
me that big hug, he got me going so it's just a great feeling."
 

   Pierce tried valiantly to out-duel Garnett and Davis, scoring 13
points in the fourth quarter to provide a steadying presence these
young Celtics have sorely missed.
 

   The Celtics led by 10 points in the first half and 107-105 with
1:17 to play after Pierce fed  Al Jefferson  for a dunk.
 

   But Garnett tied the game with two free throws, then got a steal
on the defensive end to give the Wolves a chance to win it with 3.6
seconds left.
 

   Rookie  Randy Foye  blew past  Delonte West  into the lane, forcing
Pierce to leave Davis wide open on the wing to prevent an easy
layup.
 

   "Paul had to help. Paul had no choice," coach Doc Rivers said.
"He is beating himself up in there, but he did the right thing. He
had no choice but to help on that play."
 
 
 Elias Says 
 
 
 Davis Ricky Davis ' field goal with 0.2 seconds remaining gave the Timberwolves a 109-107 win and extended the Celtics' losing streak to 18 games, the longest for any NBA team since the Magic lost 19 in a row in 2003-04. There have been 11 previous single-season losing streaks of at least 18 games by NBA teams, but Boston was only the second team to extend a streak of that length (or longer) with a one-possession loss (a margin three or fewer points). The 1981-82 Cavaliers put an exclamation point on a 19-game losing streak by dropping a 116-113 overtime decision to Detroit in their season finale.

   The  Utah Jazz  also lost 18 straight in 1982 and seven teams have
lost 19 games in a row. And the Celtics still have a ways to go to
get to the NBA record for 24 straight losses that belongs to the
 Cleveland Cavaliers , a streak that spanned the end of the 1981-82
season and start of the 1982-83 season.
 

   Boston was in control for the first 2 quarters before two of
Pierce's old teammates brought Minnesota back.
 

   Davis and Blount, who came to Minnesota in a midseason trade
last year that brought  Wally Szczerbiak  and  Michael Olowokandi  to
Boston, combined for 28 of the Wolves' 36 points in the third
quarter.
 	   Davis, who spoke openly about not wanting to be the first team
to lose to Boston since Jan. 5, had 18 in the period.
 

   "It was very important for us, pride-wise at least," Davis
said for him and Blount. "It was a big game for us."
 

   But even as Boston's lead disappeared, with Davis' 3 from the
corner giving Minnesota a 74-68 lead midway through the third
period, Pierce held the Celtics together.
 

   Pierce returned on Friday night against New Jersey after missing
the previous 24 games with a stress reaction in his left foot and
an infection in his left elbow. He was expectedly rusty in a loss
to the Nets, scoring nine points on 4-of-16 shooting in 20 minutes.
 

   In his second game back, and first start since Dec. 20, Pierce
played 32 minutes and steadied the reeling Celtics with a 3-pointer
to start the fourth quarter that gave Boston an 88-87 lead and
started a back-and-forth final period.
 

   "It is amazing how much better we are when you add that guy,"
Rivers said.
 

   Pierce's 3-pointer from the elbow gave Boston a 105-101 lead
with 3:20 to go, and he smiled at Davis and Blount as he strutted
back to the other end, convinced that things were finally going to
go Boston's way.
 

   Once again, however, the Celtics fell apart down the stretch
with three turnovers in the final 90 seconds.
 

   "Tough one, Tough one," Rivers said. "I loved the team
though."
 
 Game notes  It was Garnett's 18th career triple-double and second in
the last three games. He had one last Wednesday against Golden
State. ... Szczerbiak (ankle) and Olowokandi (illness) did not make
the trip. Rivers said there is a chance Szczerbiak will play on
Wednesday. ... The standing-room only crowd of 19,538 was just
Minnesota's fourth sellout of the season.
