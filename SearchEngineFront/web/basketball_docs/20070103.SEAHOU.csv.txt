HOUSTON (AP) -- So far, the  Houston Rockets  are finding ways to
win without  Yao Ming . Tracy McGrady  scored 31 points, topping 30 for the third
straight game, and  Juwan Howard  added 18 as the Rockets beat the
 Seattle SuperSonics  103-96 on Wednesday night. McGrady also had seven assists and  Dikembe Mutombo  grabbed 14
rebounds as the Rockets won their fourth straight game. Houston is
4-1 since Yao broke a bone in his right leg. "We don't really know when Yao is coming back," said the
7-foot-2 Mutombo, Yao's backup. "So, you don't want to wait to use
all the tools you've got in the box. That's what [Coach] Jeff [Van
Gundy] is doing, trying to challenge each one of us to play to the
best of our abilities." Ray Allen  scored 32 on 13-of-22 shooting for the Sonics, who've
lost four of their last five and 10 in a row on the road. Damien
Wilkins added 19. The Sonics shot 50 percent (36-of-72) from the field against
Houston's league-leading scoring defense. But the Rockets
outrebounded Seattle 41-32, the 24th time this season that Houston
has had the edge on the boards. The Rockets also had a season-low
eight turnovers. "With Yao out, we really try to get our turnovers down to below
14 a game," McGrady said. "We did a great job of taking care of
the ball." The Rockets improved to 6-0 at home this season when they reach
100 points. They're 36-3 at home under Van Gundy when they reach
the mark. Both teams shot well in the high-scoring opening quarter. McGrady had the prettiest basket of the night in the first,
driving around  Johan Petro , wrapping the ball behind his back on
the way up, and banking it in. McGrady had 16 in the opening
quarter and the Rockets led 32-30. "I'm just going in the attack mode," McGrady said. "I'm going
back to what I used to do and that's score the ball. With Yao in
the lineup, I don't have to do as much as I have to do right now.
He is a big piece that is missing out of our lineup." The Rockets hit 11 of their first 15 shots, then missed 10 of
their next 12. Shane Battier  sank two 3-pointers and backup guard  John Lucas 
scored eight points in the second quarter as the Rockets went to
the break with a 53-48 lead. Rafer Alston  and McGrady hit 3-pointers as Houston built a
10-point lead in the first three minutes of the third quarter.
McGrady hit another 3-pointer midway through the quarter as the
lead bulged to 12. Seattle closed the quarter with a 7-2 burst and trailed only
80-73. Battier and Alston scored in the first minute of the fourth to
push the lead back to double-digits. Alston missed his first six
shots, then hit six of his next eight. Alston shot worse than 30
percent in Houston's previous two games. "Rafer has really been struggling," Van Gundy said. "I'm
really proud of him because many times, bad first halves usually
compound with bad second halves. He showed great mental strength
bouncing back and playing a very good second half." The Rockets led 84-77 with 10:09 left when McGrady returned from
a short rest. Allen promptly hit a turnaround over  Luther Head  and
added a free throw to cut Houston's lead to four. "Ray was awfully special," Seattle coach Bob Hill said. "He
was on a mission and he put us on his back and almost carried us." Head answered with a driving layup and McGrady hit two mid-range
jumpers, the second one over Allen. Allen hit back-to-back 3-pointers over Head, but McGrady found
Mutombo underneath for a layup that put the Rockets up 100-92. The Sonics cut the lead to five and McGrady missed a pull-up in
the lane in the final minute. But Mutombo rebounded and got the
ball to Alston and the Sonics couldn't score again. "We were right there in the fourth quarter and gave ourselves a
chance, but didn't make our stops at the end," Allen said. "We
make small mistakes at crucial times of the game." Van Gundy told Mutombo he was going to play more minutes in
Yao's absence. Mutombo played 28 minutes on Wednesday night. "When it comes to rebounding, I still have a lot left,"
Mutombo said. "Right now, I have to do whatever I can to help the
team win." Game notes Mutombo has had a double-digit rebound total in four
consecutive games. ... Sonics guard  Luke Ridnour  jammed his right
thumb in the first quarter, sat out briefly, then returned with
tape around the finger. He finished with seven points and had eight
assists. ... Houston native Vince Young, named the NFL's Offensive
Rookie of the Year on Wednesday, threw autographed footballs into
the stands during a timeout. The former Texas star was wearing a
Tracy McGrady jersey and a Rockets baseball cap.
