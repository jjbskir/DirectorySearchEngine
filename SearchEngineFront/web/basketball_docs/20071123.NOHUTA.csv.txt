SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- All eyes usually focus on  Deron Williams  and  Chris Paul  when they meet. But breakout games from reserve guards  Ronnie Price  and  Jason Hart  made the difference in the latest matchup between young point guards. It started with the pair diving for a loose ball during the second-quarter rally where Utah took the lead for good, and the Jazz cruised past the  New Orleans Hornets  99-71 Friday night. "That play when Jason Hart and Ronnie Price went after the ball at the end of the first half, I think it really ignited us," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "There were a lot of people that played well, but those two guys made a huge difference in the ballgame." Price scored 12 points and Hart had 11 to help the Jazz recover from a lethargic first half and dominate the Hornets.  Carlos Boozer  added 19 points and 16 rebounds in Utah's sixth consecutive home victory. "If my name is called, I have to be ready. No matter what the circumstances, I need to be ready," said Price, who had played only 37 minutes this season but replaced  Gordan Giricek  at the 2 guard while Hart filled in when Williams went out with early foul trouble. The Hornets were ahead for much of the first half, but Price powered a 10-2 run to finish the second quarter and stake the Jazz to a 44-43 lead at halftime. He and Hart dove on the floor to keep a ball alive that ended up in  Andrei Kirilenko 's hands for a dunk seconds before the buzzer. "The biggest key to the game tonight was their bench. They really did a great job defending us and we couldn't score," Paul said. The Jazz then scored the first eight points of the third quarter. Kirilenko's tip-in made it 52-43 and the Jazz cruised from there. Ronnie Brewer  had 13 points, while Williams and  Mehmet Okur  scored 12 for the Jazz, who haven't lost here since the home opener against Houston. After  Melvin Ely 's dunk and Paul's running jumper sliced the lead to 75-64 to finish the third quarter, the Hornets missed their first 13 shots of the fourth.  Julian Wright  finally ended the drought with a dunk with 3:55 to play. By that time, the Jazz had gone on a 13-1 run and led 88-65 on Williams' drive to the basket. The Hornets, who rely on perimeter shooting after drives and kickout passes, were just 1-of-17 on 3-pointers against Utah's scrambling defense. Overall, the Hornets shot a season-low 32.9 percent in their largest margin of defeat this season. "If you're not making shots from the outside, then they aren't going to give you anything on the interior. They are just too relentless," said  David West , who had 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Hornets. Paul had 15 points and six assists, and  Tyson Chandler  added 12 points but the Hornets, whose entire lineup averages double figures, had no other player score more than six points. The Hornets had their best start in franchise history at 9-2, but have since dropped three in a row after back-to-back home losses to Orlando and Indiana earlier this week. Because Williams and Paul were the first two point guards selected in the 2005 NBA draft, they usually command center attention in these matchups. But Williams, who is recovering from minor surgery on his foot, got in early foul trouble and Paul had trouble navigating Utah's physical defense. That opened the door for Utah s lesser-known guards to steal the show. "Hart and Ronnie Price are scorers. They've scored a lot their whole lives so we re used to it. They just haven't had a chance to do it in a game this season," Boozer said. Both Price and Hart scored season highs and the Jazz offense didn't endure its typical letdown when Williams left the floor. Behind the pair's long-range shooting, the Jazz went 8-of-14 from behind the 3-point arc. "Tonight was a great night for these two guys and that is very encouraging for our team because whenever Deron's been off the floor, we've struggled a little bit," Sloan said. "But Jason Hart is getting more comfortable and obviously Ronnie Price playing the 2 guard was very good for our team." In their head-to-head battles, Williams has averaged 17 points and six assists, and his team has won six of seven meetings. Paul has averaged 15 points and eight assists.
