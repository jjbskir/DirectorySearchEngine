 Nicolas Batum  made four 3-pointers and had 16 points, and  Joel Przybilla  added 14 points and 17 rebounds as all 12 players scored for Portland, with six reaching double figures. The Trail Blazers shot 56 percent from the field (43-for-77) and finished with 28 assists. "I thought we were as efficient as we could be," Portland coach  Nate McMillan  said. "Overall, we just did a good job of playing a physical game against a team that has given us trouble in the past with its physical game." Roy, selected as a reserve for the Western Conference All-Star team on Thursday, shot 11-for-19 from the field while reaching 30 points for the seventh time this season.  LaMarcus Aldridge  also scored 14 points,  Rudy Fernandez  had 13, and  Travis Outlaw  11. The Trail Blazers pulled 1 1/2 games behind first-place Denver in the Pacific Division and handed Utah its sixth loss in eight games. "It didn't make any difference what we were trying to do defensively," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "They scored and took advantage of us. They were terrific. We never got close to guarding them. Guys were confused. It was really a nightmare." Deron Williams  scored a season-high 35 points on 12-for-18 shooting for the Jazz, who were 54 percent from the field.  Mehmet Okur  had 18 points and seven rebounds. "Bottom line, we've got to stop being so soft as a team," Williams said. "Teams push us around, and we don't push back. We're lying down and letting them walk all over us." Utah was playing without starting forwards  Andrei Kirilenko  and  Carlos Boozer . Kirilenko underwent surgery on his right ankle Friday and is expected to miss four weeks. Boozer, the team's leading scorer at 20.5 points per game, has been out since mid-November due to an injured left knee but is projected to return after the All-Star break. Portland took control of the game during the first quarter with a barrage of 3-pointers. The Blazers hit four consecutive 3s during a 3-minute stretch and five altogether during the quarter to take a 33-26 lead. Portland maintain a lead through halftime, though Williams shot 5-for-6 and scored 14 points during the second quarter. Portland quickly increased its five-point halftime lead with a strong third quarter. The Blazers were 15-for-24, including three 3-pointers, and scored 38 points during the quarter to take a 90-73 lead into the final period. "I'm happy that we controlled the game from the tip. We were probably the more physical and active team," Roy said. "It felt good to beat them soundly. It didn't come down to the last 4 minutes. We played well the entire game." The Blazers outrebounded Utah 35-27, and forced the Jazz into 16 turnovers. Game notes  Bill Bayno, who resigned as Loyola Marymount coach on Jan. 12, has returned to Portland to become a player development coach for the Blazers. Bayno was a Portland assistant for two seasons under Jeff McMillan before taking the Loyola job last April. ... Foul trouble against Utah derailed Portland center  Greg Oden  from a recent stretch of strong play. Oden, the first pick of the 2007 NBA draft, averaged 16.4 points and 11.4 rebounds during the five games coming in. Against the Jazz, he finished with five points, one rebound and five fouls. Portland is 12 games over .500 for the first time since the 2002-03 season.
