EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. --  Terrence Williams  had a text message from north of the border waiting for him after the  New Jersey Nets ' stunning double-overtime win over the  Chicago Bulls . "A couple of players from the Raptors that I know just texted me and said: 'Thank you," said Williams, who refused to name them. "It was like in my head: 'Thank you for what?' Then, oh, the eighth spot and all that. It's special because it came with a win." Williams was certainly the catalyst in the Nets' big win that prevented the Bulls from taking over the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

 The Bulls easily could have won this game, one which they rallied from a 12-point, fourth-quarter deficit. However, they allowed  Brook Lopez  to slam home a rebound with 0.1 seconds left in regulation to tie the game and then blew a seven-point lead with 69 seconds to go in the first overtime. "We weren't effective and let the game slip away," Bulls coach  Vinny Del Negro  said. "It was in hand and that's what makes this tough. We can't hang our heads. We don't have the time to do so. But when the game is on the line, you have to be able to get it done." The Nets (12-67) got the job done by scoring the final seven points in the first overtime and the first seven in the second extra session. "It was a definite playoff atmosphere because we know how much they needed this game," said Nets point guard  Devin Harris , who hit a go-ahead jumper early in the second overtime. "Toronto lost tonight, so it was really, really important for them, but we just wanted to protect home court and finish the season on a high note, so we are attacking every game." Lopez added 26 points and 14 rebounds, and Harris scored 19 as the Nets won for the fifth time in nine games.  Yi Jianlian  chipped in with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Brad Miller  scored a season-high 27 points with 10 rebounds for the Bulls, who lost for only the fourth time in 11 games. After Harris put New Jersey ahead for good, Williams hit a jumper to stretch the lead to 116-112 with 3:12 to play. Harris hit one free throw on the play Rose fouled out, then set up Yi for a dunk with 2:19 to play that seemingly took the air out of the Bulls, who were playing their second game in two nights. "They beat us real bad at their place last week so that was motivation for us," Lopez said. The Bulls nearly had the game locked up in the first overtime, scoring the first seven points and eventually leading 112-105 with 1:07 to play. New Jersey rallied, taking advantage of two turnovers by Rose in the final minute. Lopez hit two free throws to tie the game at 112 with 12.8 seconds to play and Rose missed a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer. The Nets were in danger of losing in regulation before Lopez made a spectacular rebound stuff of a missed floater by  Courtney Lee  to tie it at 103. The play was not without controversy, because replays seemed to show the ball might have been on the cylinder when Lopez jammed it home. Del Negro appealed for the officiating crew to review the play, but it was not reviewable. New Jersey used a 20-10 run bridging the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth to open an 87-76 lead on a layup by  Josh Boone . The Bulls outscored the Nets 17-7 in the final 4:42 of regulation, with Miller scoring 12 in the run. Chicago, which had not led since early in the third quarter, took a 100-99 lead when  Joakim Noah  tipped in a missed drive by Rose for a 100-99 lead with 48.6 seconds to go. A drive by Harris got New Jersey within 102-101 with 4.6 seconds left and Rose left the door open, making 1 of 2 free throws with 3.6 seconds remaining in regulation.
