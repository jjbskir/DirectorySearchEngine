ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) --  Keyon Dooling  was never much of a 3-point
shooter. The Orlando guard hit 5-of-5 from behind the arc, coming off the
bench for a career-high 25 points to lift the Magic over the Denver
Nuggets 108-99 on Wednesday night. "It was a great night. The basket felt really big for me,"
Dooling said. Carmelo Anthony  scored 34 points, his fifth straight game with
at least 30. But he committed two costly mistakes in the final
2:15, first traveling, then bobbling a pass that forced a jump ball
tipped to Dooling for a lay-up and 104-97 lead with 1:03 left. The win snapped Denver's three-game winning streak and extended
Orlando's to three games. "Our game plan was to stop Dwight (Howard),  Jameer Nelson  and
 Grant Hill , but they came off the bench, Dooling and (Carlos)
Arroyo, and gave them some spark," Anthony said. Hedu Turkoglu had 18 points and six rebounds for the Magic
before fouling out, while Grant Hill added 15 points and Carlos
Arroyo had 14 points, five assists and five rebounds. J.R. Smith  scored 17 points and  Marcus Camby  added 13 points and
12 rebounds, while  Earl Boykins  scored 11 for Denver. Anthony scored 20 points in the first half on 6-of-10 shooting,
but missed his first five shots (and two free throws) in the third
quarter. His only basket in the period came on a goaltending call
against Howard. Orlando had trouble getting the ball to Howard, racking up
several of its 26 turnovers on botched dumps inside. The forward
finished with nine points and seven rebounds. "He's going to face all those double teams in high-low
situations," Magic coach Brian Hill said. "We're not doing a good
job of feeding him in the ball when people are fronting him in the
post." Dooling scored 12 points -- nine of them on 3-pointers -- in a
15-2 run over 4 minutes that gave Orlando a four-point lead with
3:37 left in the third quarter. He added another three that gave
the Magic an 11-point edge before Denver rattled off six points to
end the period. Arroyo, who also came off the bench, had five points and two
rebounds and took a momentum-shifting charge in a 10-0 run over
3:19 that pulled Orlando back from an 11-point second-quarter
deficit. "The second unit was responsible tonight," Brian Hill said. The Nuggets announced before tipoff forward  Kenyon Martin  would
be out for the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his
right knee. The procedure on Wednesday revealed more significant
damage than a previous MRI. The former All-Star averaged 9.5 points
and 10 rebounds in two games this season, and missed a quarter of
the season last year after surgery on his other knee. Game notes Nuggets F Nene, sidelined since Friday with a bruised knee,
