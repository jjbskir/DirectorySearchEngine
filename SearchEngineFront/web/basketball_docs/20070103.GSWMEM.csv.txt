MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- As long as the  Memphis Grizzlies  want to
run, interim coach Tony Barone isn't going to bog them down with
too many set plays.

 The Grizzlies won an old-fashioned shootout against the Warriors, 144-135. It was the first NBA game in which both teams scored more than 30 points in each quarter since the Warriors defeated the Nets in overtime at New Jersey, 153-148, on March 28, 1992. Last night's combined total of 279 points by Memphis and Golden State was the highest in a regulation NBA game since Jan. 18, 1992; that game also involved Warriors (a 143-141 win at Dallas).

 The racehorse Grizzlies used a season-high 33 points from Mike
Miller, and  Pau Gasol 's 24 points and 13 rebounds Wednesday night
to beat the  Golden State Warriors  144-135. "We got tired halfway through the third quarter," Barone said.
"I saw some eyes starting to cross in the huddle. So I asked them:
'OK, would you like me to start calling plays from here on in?'
They said no, so I said: 'OK, start running again.' There's no
magic in coaching." The 144 points was a Grizzlies franchise record and the most
points scored by an NBA team in regulation this season. That's
quite a change from a team that used to rely on defense and
halfcourt offensive sets that left the Grizzlies as one of the
lowest scoring teams in the league under Mike Fratello, who was
fired as coach last week. Miller connected on 11 of 15 shots, including 9-of-12 from
3-point range. Gasol shot 9-of-14 as Memphis connected on 56
percent from the field and 55 percent from 3-point range. Stromile
Swift had 26 points and nine rebounds, and  Rudy Gay  added 22 points
for Memphis.  Damon Stoudamire  had 18 points and 16 assists. "Every once in a while it is good to be lucky," Miller said of
his shooting performance. "The guards did a good job of driving
the ball and dishing it back out. They are the ones that should get
credit when I'm out there making open shots." Miller's nine 3-point field goals were the most in his career
and a franchise record. The victory overshadowed a career-high 36 points by Golden
State's  Matt Barnes , as seven Warriors scored in double figures.
The forward, in his fourth season out of UCLA, entered the year
averaging 3.7 points and has a 10.6 average for the season. But he scored 29 Tuesday night against the Hornets, and
Wednesday's total marked the fourth time in the last six games he's
scored at least 20 points. "It's (coach Don Nelson) having confidence in me," Barnes
said. "You ask any player. It the coach is behind you 100 percent,
the best part of your game is going to come out. Early on in the
season, I was looking over my shoulder if I made a mistake and
wasn't sure if I was going to be in or not. Now that he has
confidence in me, no matter how I'm shooting, he tells me to keep
shooting." Baron Davis  scored 22 points and had 13 assists for Golden
State.  Mike Dunleavy  scored 16 points, and  Mickael Pietrus  and
Kelenna Azubuike had 15 apiece. Azubuike was signed by the Warriors on Tuesday after averaging
26 points with the Fort Worth Flyers of the NBA Development League.
 Andris Biedrins  had 12 points and nine rebounds before fouling out. The Warriors led 122-119 with 5 minutes left when the Grizzlies
put together a 16-5 run keyed by three 3-pointers from Miller.
Gasol finished off the run with two free throws with 1:52 left to
make it 135-127, sending Memphis to its second win in three games
under Barone. "Defensively, we didn't do our jobs in the fourth quarter
against Miller," Nelson said. "He got open and made the hard
shots. We should have done a better job of not allowing him to get
open. He had a truly amazing performance." The Warriors led 68-67 at halftime. Several times Memphis failed to get back on defense, leading to
easy Golden State baskets as the Warriors sent someone flying to
the offensive end even after a made Memphis basket. That
contributed to 29 fast-break points in the first half for Golden
State. Barnes benefited from several of the Grizzlies' defensive
lapses, scoring 23 in the half. Miller and Barnes continued to match each other in the third
period. The Grizzlies reached the 100-point mark with 2 minutes
left in the third and carried a 101-99 lead into the final period. It marked the first time the Grizzlies had reached the century
mark before the fourth since November 2004. "They're drastically different," Dunleavy said of the new
Memphis look. "They are trying to push the ball. They're trying to
take every shot that's available. I'm sure the guys on the team
like playing it. Defensively, they are giving up more points, but
offensively, they can really score." Game notes The teams combined for 68 attempts from 3-point range, one
shy of an NBA record. ...The Warriors' starting lineup with
Azubuike at guard marked the 18th different opening five for Golden
State. Azubuike missed his first six shots before hitting two in a
row. ... Memphis has allowed at least 100 points in the last nine
games. Opponents are averaging 112 points in that stretch. ... Gay
started his 10th game of the season and connected on the first shot
of the game. ...Golden State's 135 points was a season high and
second-highest by a Grizzlies opponent in franchise history.
