MIAMI (AP) -- The  Philadelphia 76ers  rallied in overtime to avoid becoming Miami's first victims in nearly a month. Andre Iguodala  scored 24 points and converted a key three-point play as the 76ers scored the final 10 points in overtime and sent the Heat to their 11th straight loss, 101-96 on Saturday night. Andre Miller  scored 24 points and  Willie Green  added 14 for the Sixers, who fell behind early in the extra period before coming on in the last few minutes. "We could have easily just given in, but we fought through it," Miller said. "We found a way to dig it out." Ricky Davis  scored the first basket of overtime when he followed  Dwyane Wade 's fast-break miss with 2:58 left. On the Heat's next possession, Davis sank a 3-pointer that built a 96-91 lead with 2:24 left. Louis Williams  sank two free throws and Miller's fast-break dunk cut Philadelphia's deficit to 96-95 with 1:26 left. Iguodala's three-point play with 1:08 to go gave Philadelphia a 98-96 edge. After Wade and  Shawn Marion  missed in close, Iguodala's basket with 37 seconds left made it 100-96. "To be down five in overtime and come back to win is huge for us," 76ers coach Maurice Cheeks said. "We could have hung our heads." Wade scored 33 points for the Heat, who have dropped 26 of their last 27. Miami also had a 15-game losing streak from Dec. 25-Jan. 24 that ended when it beat Indiana 98-96 on Jan. 26. "Nobody in this locker room is going to quit," Wade said. "The ball is going to drop as it's going to drop and we have to accept that and move on." Philadelphia outrebounded Miami 50-33 and had 17 offensive rebounds. "We did everything we could to win, except win," Miami coach Pat Riley said. "They kicked our butts on the boards." The Sixers used a 10-3 run to grab an 85-83 lead with 5:13 left in regulation. After Wade hit a jumper to tie the score, Louis Williams' fast-break slam and Iguodala's two free throws gave Philadelphia an 89-85 edge with 2:53 to go. Wade's two free throws and  Udonis Haslem 's foul-line jumper tied it at 89 with 1:32 left. Another jumper by Haslem was answered by two foul shots by Miller with 1:04 showing. Jason Williams ' 3-point attempt from the left corner bounced off the rim shortly before time expired in regulation. Wade had 17 of his 21 first-half points in the second quarter, but the Sixers led 51-49 at halftime. Marion scored just four points in 40 minutes of his fifth game since joining Miami. "This one is really frustrating because we fought so hard and really feel like we had it at the end," Marion said. Game notes  Haslem returned after missing nine games with a sprained left ankle. ... Miami's  Dorell Wright  left in the third quarter after losing two teeth when he took an elbow to the face. ... The Sixers are off until Wednesday night, when they play host to Orlando.
