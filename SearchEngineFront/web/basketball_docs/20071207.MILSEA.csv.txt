SEATTLE (AP) --  Kevin Durant  sure did a lot right offensively. His most impressive accomplishment came at the defensive end. The 19-year-old rookie did a lot of scoring and a little of everything else, matching his career high with 35 points as the  Seattle SuperSonics  beat the  Milwaukee Bucks  104-98 on Friday night. Durant knocked down pull-up jumpers in the face of  Desmond Mason  in the closing minutes of a tight game. He battled against Milwaukee's big frontline in the paint and earned his way to the free throw line 16 times. But his most impressive moment: blocking the quick-release shot of  Michael Redd . "I wasn't planning on blocking it," Durant said. Durant scored 24 points in the second half, to go along with eight rebounds an assist and five blocked shots. He managed to counterbalance Redd, who finished with a season-high 41 points, including 25 in the second half. The difference -- Durant got more help from his teammates. Five Sonics finished in double figures and Seattle's bench outscored the Bucks' reserves 30-12. "This is the kind of player everyone anticipated coming into this league," Milwaukee coach Larry Krystkowiak said. Durant was most impressive in the fourth quarter, but wasn't without assistance from  Chris Wilcox ,  Earl Watson  and  Nick Collison , all of whom added key scores in the final 8 minutes to help Seattle win consecutive home games for the first time since last March. Equally dazzling was Redd. He and Durant each scored 18 points in the fourth quarter, each with identical stat lines -- 4 of 7 shooting, 1 of 2 on 3-pointers, 9 of 10 at the free-throw line. Redd made 12 of 24 shots, including four 3-pointers and was 13 of 14 at the line. Durant was 9 of 20 shooting, with two 3-pointers and made 15 of 16 foul shots. "I love that challenge and being put in that position," Redd said. "Seattle was trying to play all kinds of funky defenses, box-and-one's, and all kinds of crazy defenses. It didn't matter, but at the end of the day, they got the win." Redd made 12 of 24 shots, including four 3-pointers and was 13 of 14 at the line. Durant was 9 of 20 shooting, with two 3-pointers and made 15 of 16 foul shots. Andrew Bogut ,  Yi Jianlian  and  Mo Williams  all added 13 for the Bucks. Exhausted by his effort, Redd could only put his hands on his knees after missing an open 5-footer with 14 seconds left that was Milwaukee's last chance to complete a rally. Milwaukee lost for the sixth time in its last seven games. "We came to play, we just couldn't make shots and we couldn't make stops when we needed them," Redd said. Redd single-handedly brought the Bucks back even early in the fourth quarter. He scored seven of Milwaukee's first nine fourth-quarter points, capping his own mini run by shaking past Durant at the top of the key and scoring a goaltended basket to tie the game 77-all. Durant didn't idly stand by. After Redd pulled the Bucks even, Durant scored five straight, spinning in a tough baseline drive, then pounding his chest after a deep 3-pointer. But then Durant's teammates started chipping in. Durant scored just one of Seattle's next eight points as the Sonics took a 90-84 lead with 3 minutes left. The rookie then put a capper on the night, hitting consecutive pull up jumpers over Mason to push the Sonics lead to eight, and hit eight free throws in the final 2 minutes. It was Durant's second 35-point effort, matching his total from Nov. 30 against Indiana. Wilcox added 14 points -- 13 coming in the first half -- and Watson, Collison and  Wally Szczerbiak  all scored 12. Wilcox finished with 13 rebounds and  Kurt Thomas  grabbed 11. Seattle also outscored Milwaukee 34-22 at the free throw line. "We're still learning ... but we're improving, which is a good sign," Seattle coach P.J. Carlesimo said. "We still have a ways to go." Redd not only took over in the fourth quarter, but also was the catalyst behind a third-quarter spurt that gave Milwaukee its first lead since the opening moments. Redd hit consecutive 3's, and four straight points by Williams gave the Bucks a 67-66 lead late in the third quarter. But Seattle responded, closing the quarter on a 7-1 run, highlighted by Durant swooping in from the wing and slamming a lob pass from Watson. The Sonics never trailed again.
