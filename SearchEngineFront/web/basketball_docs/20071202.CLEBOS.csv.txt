BOSTON (AP) --  LeBron James  watched from the bench in street
clothes. The show he saw wasn't very pretty. 	   "There'll be no video on this game, hopefully," Celtics coach
Doc Rivers said. "It was not a piece of art." 	   Boston plodded to an 80-70 win over the  Cleveland Cavaliers  on
Sunday. But the NBA's leading scorer was sidelined with a sprained
finger, the NBA's best team had little energy, and the crowd that
showed up for the rare 12:30 p.m. start was subdued. 	   "Afternoon games aren't one of my favorites to begin with,"
Boston's  Kevin Garnett  said. 	   He and  Paul Pierce  each scored under 10 points. Garnett had only
nine in 26 minutes two games after his streak of 435 games,
including playoffs, of scoring in double figures ended when he had
eight points in 23 minutes of a 104-59 win over the New York
Knicks. 	   "We just didn't have the energy we normally come out with,"
said Pierce, who had seven points in 30 minutes. "I don't know if
part of it was [the game] being early. I don't know if part of it
was LeBron not playing, but we usually come out with a better
start." 	   James, who missed his second straight game, is day-to-day,
Cleveland coach Mike Brown said. 	   The Celtics led just 43-39 at the end of a slow-paced first
half. It was 48-44 before an 8-point run put them ahead 56-44 with
4:52 left in the third quarter. 	   That's when Cleveland called a timeout. James, watching from his
bench in street clothes, smiled and gestured toward Boston's Scot
Pollard, who played on Cleveland's Eastern Conference finalists
last season. 	   "When King James goes down, you feel like you have to carry the
team by yourself offensively,"  Drew Gooden  said. "I think we are
starting to get better at doing that, but then again that is not our
identity. Our identity is having him make plays for us." 	   On Tuesday night, the Cavaliers handed the Celtics one of their
two losses of the season, 109-104 in overtime at Cleveland. James
scored 38 points, 11 of them in overtime, and added 13 assists. 	   But the next night in a 109-74 loss in Detroit, James sprained
his left index finger in the second quarter. Cleveland lost again
Friday night, 91-82 at Toronto. 	   "Like in Toronto, the effort was there," Brown said, "but
we've got to find a way to score." 	   Boston improved to an NBA best 14-2 and was led by  Ray Allen 
with 20 points and  Rajon Rondo  with 12. Cleveland was led by
 Zydrunas Ilgauskas  with 12 points and 13 rebounds and Sasha
Pavlovic with 11 points. Gooden had a double-double at halftime and
finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds. 	   "We anticipated LeBron playing," Garnett said. "He didn't,
but the world doesn't stop. The game definitely doesn't stop." 	   Last season, without Garnett and Allen, the Celtics didn't get
their 14th win until Feb. 26, their 56th game -- 40 more than it
took this season. They're 9-0 at home one season after getting
their ninth win there on March 14, their 32nd home game. 	   "As much as we have our comforts here at home, you start to
extend those on the road and it makes you better on the road,
too," Allen said. 	   Boston took its biggest lead, 77-56. Then, with substitutes on
the floor, Cleveland cut the lead in the final five minutes but
never threatened. 	   "The Celtics turned it up coming out of halftime, put pressure
on us and we didn't handle the pressure," Brown said. 	   The Celtics opened a 64-50 lead after three quarters, then
started the fourth with layups by  James Posey  and  Glen Davis , a
fun-loving rookie who provided the energy Rivers was seeking. 	   "Big Baby is the personality of the  Boston Celtics ," Garnett
said, using Davis' college nickname at LSU. "He has an aura around
him which followed him, which he carries on and off the court." 	   Boston took its 77-56 lead on a free throw by  Tony Allen 
following a 3-pointer by  Eddie House . 	   In the first half, Cleveland capitalized with Boston's starters
on the bench and took its biggest lead of the game, 30-23 midway
through the second quarter. It was 32-27 by the time all five
Celtics starters were back in the court. 	   Ilgauskas hit a free throw before the Celtics scored the next
nine points for a 36-33 lead. Ray Allen had four of the points,
including a stuff that ended the run after he stole the ball at
midcourt. 	   The Celtics won despite hitting just 37.5 percent of their shots
and going only 2-for-14 from 3-point range. The Cavaliers were even
worse with a 32.9 field goal percentage. 	   The Celtics had played back-to-back 8 p.m. games before flying
home from Miami on Saturday. 	   "Our bodies are tired," Pierce said. "So we had to come in
here and be mentally ready." Game notes All of Boston's 14 first-half field goals came inside the
paint. ...  Devin Brown  started in place of James and was scoreless
on four shots in 21 minutes. ... Each team was assessed two
technical fouls. Boston also was hit with two technicals for
defensive 3 seconds.
