Ford ,  Anthony Parker  and  Jorge Garbajosa  each added 17 points for Toronto, which shot 58.7 percent from the field. "It's unbelievable," said Toronto's  Jose Calderon . "Everybody in this locker room is better than they were in the preseason because we've learned to play as a team." A cheer went up in the Raptors' locker room when  Tyronn Lue  hit a jumper at the buzzer to lift Atlanta to an overtime victory against New Jersey, putting Toronto three games ahead of the Nets. The Raptors haven't been .500 this late in the season since 2001-02. Cuttino Mobley  scored 24 points and  Elton Brand  had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, who had won seven of their past eight games. "Give them a lot of credit, they played well, they made shots,"  Sam Cassell  said. "Everything we did to try and stop them, they did better." Ford and Calderon, Toronto's two point guards, combined for 27 points and 19 assists. Calderon had 10 points and 12 assists and started in place of Ford, who has been bothered by a sore right ankle. "Things are going well right now with the situation, but it's not my call," Peterson said of the point guard shuffle.
