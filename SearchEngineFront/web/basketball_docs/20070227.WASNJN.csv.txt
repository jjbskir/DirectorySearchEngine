EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The  Washington Wizards  dared the  New Jersey Nets  to beat them from long range, and that's exactly what  Jason Kidd  and his teammates did.

 Carter   Vince Carter  took game honors with 27 points, but it was  Jason Kidd  who put on a show that Meadowlands fans will remember long after the team settles in Brooklyn. Kidd sunk five 3-point field goals within a span of three minutes, 10 seconds in the third quarter of the Nets' 113-101 victory over the Wizards. 
 
The last NBA player to make five 3-pointers in a span of less than four minutes was  Quentin Richardson , then with Phoenix, in December 2004. Prior to that,  Kobe Bryant  turned the five-3s-in-less-than-four-minutes trick in January 2003. 
 
And, no, that's not a typo on  Jason Collins ' line: he played 30:47 without attempting a field goal or a free throw. The last starting center to play at least 30 minutes in an NBA game and take no shots was Lorenzo Williams of the Mavericks on Jan. 23, 1995.

 Kidd had 26 points, nine assists and eight rebounds and the Nets hit a franchise-record 16 3-pointers in a 113-101 victory over the injury-ravaged Wizards on Tuesday night. "It was more or less beat us from the outside," Kidd said when asked about the Wizards' defense. "We kind of fell in the trap in the first half but we were wide open." In winning their third straight game and handing the Wizards their third straight loss, the Nets never let a second-quarter cold streak -- they missed 9-of-11 in one stretch late in the period -- deter them from taking what was there. "Guys started hitting shots," said  Vince Carter , who added 27 points. "We were getting good looks from 3, so we were just taking the shots that were there." The Nets finished 16-of-32 from 3-point land with Kidd having a better than normal night from long range, hitting 6-of-10.  Bostjan Nachbar , who scored 23 off the bench, and  Eddie House  added three 3s apiece and Carter and  Clifford Robinson  each had two. Gilbert Arenas  had 26 points on 7-of-25 shooting for the Wizards, who played without All-Star forward  Caron Butler  (back spasms) for the second straight game and  Antawn Jamison , who has been sidelined with a knee injury since late January. Jarvis Hayes  added a season-high 21 points for Washington. "They were hot today and we gave up too many open looks," said Wizards guard  Roger Mason  Jr., who tied a career high with 18 points. "Defensively our rotations weren't what they needed to be obviously." Kidd put on a show in the third quarter, scoring 19 points on a 7-of-10 shooting. The All-Star point guard single-handedly led a 19-5 spurt in a 3:09 span, hitting five 3-pointers and handing out assists on the other two baskets in rallying New Jersey from an eight-point deficit. "He was unbelievable," Carter said. "His ability to pass the ball, get to the hole and then he is taking shots. He was fun to watch. He was tough." Despite all his work, the Nets only held a 79-78 lead entering the final quarter. There were five lead changes in the opening minutes of the final quarter, before Carter found House alone in the corner for a 3-pointer for an 88-86 lead with 9:04 to play. The shot ignited a 13-3 spurt that featured nine points by Nachbar, including a 3-pointer and a big dunk coming down the lane. Washington made two runs in the final minutes. A 3-pointer by  DeShawn Stevenson  got it within 99-94 with less than five minutes to play but Nachbar hit another 3-pointer. A 3-pointer by Hayes with about three minutes to go got the Wizards within 104-97, but Kidd drove the lane for a basket.
