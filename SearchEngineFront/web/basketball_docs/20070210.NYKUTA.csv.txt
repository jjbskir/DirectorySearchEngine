SALT LAKE CITY --  Mehmet Okur  sat exhausted in his locker, too tired to relish scoring 29 points and leading Utah to its fourth straight win. Okur hadn't eaten for more than a day because of a stomach bug, and had just played more than 43 minutes in helping lead the Jazz back from a 10-point deficit and beat the  New York Knicks  104-102 on Saturday night. "I feel weak. I just want to go home," said Okur, whose layup with 12 seconds left in regulation forced the overtime. Derek Fisher  scored 14, breaking a tie with 3 seconds left on a layup off a pass from  Deron Williams , who had 10 assists for Utah. The Jazz ended a five-game losing streak against the Knicks despite having a weary Okur,  Andrei Kirilenko  playing gingerly with back spasms and Fisher favoring a sore toe. "I'm just happy with the way these guys played," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "I thought they played their hearts out to try to win the game. That speaks volumes for them." Paul Millsap  had 18 points and nine rebounds, and  Matt Harpring  added 13 points and seven boards for the Jazz, who won despite getting outrebounded 50-36 and going just 15-for-27 from the foul line. Crawford led the Knicks with 29 points and 10 rebounds and  Eddy Curry  scored 27 for the Knicks, who had  Steve Francis  (13 points, seven rebounds) back in the lineup after he missed 17 games.  David Lee  finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds and  Quentin Richardson  had 10 rebounds and nine points, hitting a 3-pointer to tie it at 102 with 22 seconds left to play. After Richardson's shot, the Jazz ran down the clock and Williams bounced a pass to Fisher, who sneaked behind the defense and lofted the ball over the rim to put the Jazz up 104-102 with 3.6 seconds left. "Fish went back door. I just hit him with the pass and he laid it up," Williams said. The Knicks called time out after the play, but couldn't get a good look for the final shot. New York coach Isiah Thomas went to midcourt after the buzzer and complained that Crawford was fouled on a shot at the buzzer that was waved off, but the game was over. Thomas was still angry in the locker room. "Hey, this is going to be real quick fellas," Thomas said. "I have absolutely no comment on tonight's game." It wasn't clear if Thomas was angry about his team losing or the officiating, which included a technical foul on David Lee after a dunk in overtime. "We competed, but we hurt ourselves," Crawford said. "We had 22 turnovers. They made some big plays. Okur got going. We didn't do the things that we were doing to get the lead." The Knicks opened the third quarter with an 8-0 run and were up by 10 entering the fourth. New York led 89-79 on  Stephon Marbury 's reverse layup with 5:03 left before the Jazz rallied with an 11-0 run. Harpring made a 3 from the top of the key to pull Utah within 89-82 with 4:41 left, then after Crawford missed a 3 and Okur got the rebound, Okur hit a 3 to cut the lead to 89-85 with 4:05 remaining. Harpring tried another 3 that was way short, but Millsap turned the air ball into an alley-oop layup. After Fisher stole the ball from Marbury, Okur was open outside and gave the Jazz their first lead since early in the third quarter with another 3-pointer. The Knicks led 93-91 in the final minute when Okur's runner with 12.7 seconds left banged hard off the glass and in to tie it again. Crawford's shot just before the buzzer missed and the game went to overtime. Game notes  The Knicks had three turnovers before they made a field goal in overtime. ...
