PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nate McMillan went to an unlikely place to
find his starting point guard Friday night: the end of the bench. With  Jarrett Jack  injured in an auto accident earlier in the
day, the Trail Blazers' coach tabbed little-used  Dan Dickau  for the
start, and his steady play helped Portland pick up its second win
over the  Sacramento Kings  in a week. Zach Randolph  had 23 points and 12 rebounds, and  Juan Dixon 
added 21 points in the Blazers' 95-87 win. Brandon Roy  had 11 points and five assists, and Dickau added a
season-high 11 points. "It feels good. It was nice when coach told me I was going to
play," Dickau said. "I'm going to just keep plugging away and
when the next opportunity comes, I'll be ready." Kevin Martin  had 17 points for the Kings, losers of four
straight.  Ron Artest  had 12 of his 16 in the third quarter. Corliss
Williamson added 14 points,  Mike Bibby  13 and  John Salmons  12 for
the Kings, who had 21 turnovers. The Blazers had 19 turnovers and the teams combined for 52 fouls
-- including 11 on the offensive end by the Blazers. Blazers officials said Jack suffered a concussion when he lost
control of the car he was driving and slid into a parked car near
the team's practice facility in Tualatin. A fourth-year pro, Dickau had been the Blazers' fourth point
guard behind Jack, Roy and  Sergio Rodriguez , and had played in only
18 of Portland's previous 37 games. Dickau missed much of last season with the  Boston Celtics  after
suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon. He's averaging 2.5 points per
game this year. "The reason I started Dan was because of his experience,"
McMillan said. "He has played more minutes [throughout his career]
at the point than any of our other guys. You can't play everyone,
but I thought Dan was ready for it. I thought about it and Dan was
the best player to go to." The Blazers pulled away in the fourth quarter with Dixon
providing much of the offense. He had 14 in the quarter, making
five of seven shots, including two key 3-pointers. "That was the difference tonight," Sacramento coach Eric
Musselman said. "And they defended us well in the fourth period." Sacramento, which opened a stretch with nine of 12 games on the
road, dropped to 4-9 away from Arco Arena. "You have to play at both ends of the floor," Williamson said.
"We need to get stops on defense and we didn't do that tonight." The Kings led 15-7 after Bibby's 3-pointer from the corner and
increased their advantage to as many as 11 in the first half. The Blazers came back and took the lead with a 15-5 run before
halftime. Roy tied the score at 40 with a twisting reverse layup
and then beat the halftime buzzer with another reverse the next
time down the floor. Portland led 59-54 with 4:22 left in the third after consecutive
3-pointers from Dickau. A jumper from Randolph at 8:42 in the fourth gave the Blazers a
78-69 lead. Randolph pushed the advantage to double-digits by
making one free throw and Dixon followed with a 3-pointer that
buried the Kings for good. The Kings won the first meeting with Portland this season, but
the Blazers won 110-105 in overtime at Sacramento last Saturday.
The Blazers went on to lose their next three games, including
Wednesday at Dallas, where they scored a season-low 74 points. Game notes The Kings had given up 100 or more points in five of their
last six games. ... C  Joel Przybilla  continued to struggle for
Portland, with just three points and four rebounds in 16 minutes,
while sitting the whole fourth quarter. ... The Kings had won in
their previous two visits to Portland. ... McMillan said Jack could
miss up to a week as a precaution. ...  Ime Udoka  had 10 points and
nine rebounds for the Blazers.
