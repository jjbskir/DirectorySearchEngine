SALT LAKE CITY (AP) --  Jerry Stackhouse  got thrown out and  Dirk Nowitzki  got zoned in. Stackhouse was ejected at the end of the third quarter for his
second flagrant foul, but Nowitzki stepped up with a season-high 38
points, including two free throws with 10.2 seconds remaining, to
help the  Dallas Mavericks  beat the  Utah Jazz  108-105 on Tuesday
night. "More than anything, I think Stack really set a great example
for us, how he played hard and he left it all out there," Nowitzki
said. "That's why we have him. "You know, he's a big key of why we went to the finals last
year. He's probably one of our toughest guys out there and that
[the flagrant foul calls] definitely jump-started us." The 7-foot German, who has averaged more than 30 points in his
last six games, scored 25 in the second half as the Mavs avenged a
101-79 loss to Utah on Dec. 11, when they shot a season-low 37.7
percent. "I think in the second half we turned it around a little bit,"
Nowitzki said. "In this building they play so hard, you have to
match their physical contact and I think we try to get to basket,
get to foul line, guys did a great job in the second half." The Mavs had no trouble this time, as they made 53 percent of
their field goals and handed the Jazz just their third home loss of
the season. Stackhouse was kicked out after getting called for his second
flagrant foul. He also was hit with a technical in the first half
for an argument with Utah coach Jerry Sloan. "It's personal. They don't like me and I don't like them,"
Stackhouse said. Josh Howard  scored 21 points and  Jason Terry  shook off a recent
slump to score 11 of his 18 in the fourth quarter. "[Utah] is very physical, but tonight we matched their
aggression and came out on top with the win," said Terry. "We had
more emphasis on being aggressive tonight, taking what the defense
gives you and attacking." The Mavs, who have the NBA's best record at 28-8, bounced back
after falling 101-98 to the  Los Angeles Lakers  on Sunday, breaking
their 13-game win streak that began the game after the last loss to
Utah. "I was able to find some open looks. There will be some nights
where the basket is a little bigger and you feel great about
yourself," said Nowitzki, who was 12-of-18 from the floor and
13-of-15 from the line. The Jazz, who were led by  Carlos Boozer 's 29 points, shot just
8-of-21 in the final period after hitting 57 percent to that point. "We just have lapses sometimes. We feel like we'll win when we
execute our type of basketball. I think we got away from that a
little bit," Utah's  Deron Williams  said. The Jazz led 94-91 on  Derek Fisher 's 3-pointer to beat the shot
clock. But Terry's free throws capped an 11-3 run as the Mavs held
the Jazz without a field goal for more than 4 minutes to take a
102-97 lead with 2:38 to play. Utah had three chances to draw even in the last minute after
Howard missed a layup and two tip attempts,  Devin Harris  threw a
bad pass and Nowitzki inexplicably drove for a layup and missed
before the final buzzer. "A dumb play," Nowitzki said. But the Jazz could not convert any of their last-minute 3-point
attempts, including  Mehmet Okur 's desperation turnaround shot when
Utah inbounded with just 0.3 seconds to play. "Have you ever eaten red beans and rice? Okur was the rice and
we wanted to be the beans and be all over him. He's a great
shooter. We wanted to stick with him as close as we could," Mavs
coach  Avery Johnson  said. Okur and  Matt Harpring  each scored 14 points for the Jazz, who
lost for the first time this season at home when leading at
halftime. With 32 seconds left in the first quarter, Stackhouse caught
Harpring square in the jaw and dropped him in an attempt to clear
the ball. The officials immediately called a flagrant foul on
Stackhouse. Stackhouse then got a technical foul after he jawed with Sloan
near midcourt. Stackhouse, who had 11 points, was ejected with 7.8 seconds left
in the third quarter when he flagrantly fouled  Jarron Collins  on
his way to the hoop. "It's just another team that I can be passionate against.
They're going to hold and grab try to play a fake physical game,"
Stackhouse said. Stackhouse and the Jazz have a history of fighting. In 1996,
Stackhouse grabbed former Utah guard Jeff Hornacek by the throat
and hit his face at least two times. After a game in 2005,
Stackhouse and Utah's  Kirk Snyder  scuffled in a hallway near the
Jazz team bus. Though Utah trailed by seven early, Boozer led the Jazz to a
53-45 halftime lead. Twice, Boozer stole the ball and drove down
the court for a dunk. The Mavs beat San Antonio 90-85, lost the tight game to the
Lakers and beat the Jazz on a three-game stretch against some of
the Western Conference's best teams. "It was a tough physical game. Both teams were playing some
hungry basketball," Johnson said. "I like the way our team hung
in there through a lot of adversity." Game Notes The Mavs are just 4-6 when their opponents score 100 or
more points. ... Johnson also got a technical foul just after
halftime. ... Dallas is 23-0 when shooting the same or better than
its opponent. Even before his second flagrant foul, Stackhouse was
booed by the sellout crowd each time he touched the ball.
