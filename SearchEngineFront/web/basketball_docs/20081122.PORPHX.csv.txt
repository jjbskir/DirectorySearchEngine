PHOENIX -- The old man showed the kid he still has something left. Shaquille O'Neal  had 19 points and 17 rebounds to power the  Phoenix Suns  to a 102-92 victory over  Greg Oden  and the  Portland Trail Blazers  on Saturday night. O'Neal's performance included a head-first dive over the first two rows of seats trying to save a loose ball with 2:55 to play as fearful fans scattered in every direction. "Shaq has been great all year at getting the ball in the post," Suns coach  Terry Porter  said. "When they double, he's kicking it out and our guys have just been in a position to knock shots town." Oden, meanwhile, watched mostly from the bench but did get a bit of court time against the 36-year-old O'Neal. Shaq said he didn't offer any advice. "I'm the shogun," O'Neal said. "And before you get to the shogun, you've got to go through a lot of ninjas. He has to go through  Dwight Howard  and Yao Ming and by that time, I'll be out of here." Amare Stoudemire added 17 points,  Steve Nash  had 16 on 6-for-7 shooting with seven assists, and  Grant Hill  scored 15 for the Suns, who beat the Blazers for the second time in Phoenix this season. The Suns'  Raja Bell  scored all 14 of his points in the second half. Brandon Roy  scored 26 points for Portland.  Steve Blake  added 22, 14 in the third quarter. The Blazers, playing for the second night in a row after winning at Sacramento on Friday, have lost 11 straight against Phoenix. The Suns have a nine-game home winning streak against Portland. "It's one more loss right now," Roy said. "I don't even look at the big streak because we haven't beat any of the good teams on the road." The Suns shot 53 percent to Portland's 39 percent. Despite the presence of the massive O'Neal, Phoenix is still Nash's team," Trail Blazers coach  Nate McMillan  said. O'Neal, McMillan said, "does what he does, which is establish the post." "He was down there deep and he was able to score and make some plays kicking the ball out, McMillan said. "The guy is Nash. He's still orchestrating that offense and getting everybody involved. ... That show runs with Nash." O'Neal had eight points and 13 rebounds in the first half as the Suns took a 41-36 lead at the break. Phoenix led throughout the second quarter, going up 40-30 on  Boris Diaw 's layup with 1:01 remaining. The Blazers, who shot just 34 percent in the first two quarters, outscored the Suns 6-1 in the final 50 seconds of the half, capped by Roy's 20-footer with 1.1 seconds left. Blake and  LaMarcus Aldridge  each scored six in a 17-11 Portland run to start the second half. Aldridge capped the surge with a fast-break dunk that gave the Blazers a 53-52 lead with 6:47 left in the third quarter. Blake's second 3-pointer in a row put Portland up 59-57, but Bell responded with his second consecutive 3. That ignited an 12-0 run that put Phoenix ahead for good 69-59.  Matt Barnes  and Nash each made a 3 during the run. Phoenix started the fourth quarter with a 6-1 spurt to take a 78-63 lead on Stoudemire's layup with 11:10 to play. The Trail Blazers scored the next 11 points to cut it to 78-74 on Blake's 16-footer with 7:27 left. Phoenix regained control with an 12-4 run, Bell's layup after a steal making it 90-78 with 4:05 to play. Game notes  The Suns expect  Leandro Barbosa  back at practice Sunday. He has missed five games to return to Brazil following the death of his mother. ... Turnovers continued to plague the Suns. They had 18 to Portland's nine. ... The Blazers scored 233 points in their previous two games -- wins over Chicago and Sacramento.
