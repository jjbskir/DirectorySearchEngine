MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Maybe Pat Riley got a little carried away with the praise. With the Heat working on an 0-for-March, Miami's backcourt tandem of  Jason Williams  and  Chris Quinn  reversed a 14-point second-half deficit and had their coach comparing them to Hall of Famer guards Jerry West and Gail Goodrich. "We'd lost eight in a row and it gets a little tough when you're losing all the time, so you need some of these games just to feel good about yourself," said Riley, who made it a point of referring to Quinn as Goodrich as he walked by after the game. Riley played with West and Goodrich with the Lakers in the early 1970s. Williams scored 21 points, going 6-of-7 from the free-throw line down the stretch, and Quinn added three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and a sealing layup late as the Heat beat the Bucks 112-106 on Tuesday night. "Obviously this season hasn't been a lot of fun with all the losing," Quinn said. "Tonight we were able to have fun out there and play well together as a team so it was enjoyable." Williams added 10 assists and  Ricky Davis  also had a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists. The Heat had a season-high 33 assists. "We shared the ball," Williams said. "It feels good to get a win, they're few and far between around here." Earl Barron  scored 16 points and  Daequan Cook  added 12 for Miami, which improved to 6-26 on the road this season, including two wins in its last four away from home. Michael Redd  scored 18 of his 27 points in the first half for Milwaukee, which has lost six straight and blown its fair share of big advantages in the second half this season, including an 11-point lead against Utah late in the fourth quarter on Wednesday. "I don't feel like guys have turned me off. People are still paying attention, but that's a rough question to ask a coach," said Bucks coach Larry Krystkowiak, who called the team's inability to get stops in the fourth quarter "super frustrating." Miami took its first lead in more than 30 minutes when Quinn hit back-to-back 3-pointers to make it 82-77 with just under nine minutes to play. Milwaukee, which also got 26 points from  Mo Williams  and a season-high 14 points and 16 rebounds from  Michael Ruffin , missed nine of its first 10 shots in the fourth quarter and unraveled. The Heat, meanwhile, kept hitting 3s, with Quinn's third of the quarter making it 88-80 in the 19-3 run. Williams got in the act, too, pumping his fist and grinning at the bench as he added two more 3s to push the lead to 100-86. Milwaukee tried to rally, but never got closer than four in the waning seconds after Quinn sealed it with a driving layup past Ruffin. "You have to give the Heat a little credit," Ruffin said. "It wasn't like they were shooting lay-ups. They were shooting 22-foot jump shots and every last one of them was falling in." For at least one night, Miami could forget it still has the NBA's worst record at 12-54 as Riley prepares to return to collegiate scouting this weekend. Riley, who turns 63 on Thursday, hung out at Bruce Springsteen's concert on Monday in Milwaukee before his real boss, Heat owner Micky Arison, sends him back on the road. Riley confirmed he'd coach the team in Toronto on Wednesday night, but wouldn't tell where he was going this weekend or how long he'll stay, saying it depended on which players advanced in the NCAA tournament. Riley's last scouting tour came just over a week ago when he went to four cities in two days, watching tournament games at the Southeastern Conference, Conference USA, Big 12 and Atlantic Coast Conference. The Heat have the best chance (25 percent) at landing the No. 1 pick in the lottery before the June draft. Miami has never had a pick higher than fourth. Milwaukee (23-44) is in line for a high draft pick, too, its third lottery pick in four years after using the No. 1 pick on  Andrew Bogut  in 2005 and the sixth pick on  Yi Jianlian  this season.
