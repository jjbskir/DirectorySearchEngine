OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Jackson  has a simple wish for his teammates: Just stay healthy. Jackson scored 31 points,  Monta Ellis  had season highs of 29 points and 11 rebounds, and the  Golden State Warriors  put a dent into Dallas' playoff run, beating the Mavericks 119-110 Friday night. "We're seeing where we are going to be next year," Jackson said after scoring 30 points for the ninth time. "Everybody needs to finish on a good note and get a good feeling going into next year. But please, I want everybody to finish healthy." Kelenna Azubuike  and  Anthony Randolph  each added 14 points for the Warriors, who won their second straight despite playing without two of their stars. Golden State has yet to play a game with its projected starting lineup. "With everybody back I think we showed what we can do," Ellis said. "I felt like the old Monta. My shot has always been there. It's not something I was worried about. What's important is I feel good out there." Ellis missed five months of court time after badly injuring his ankle last summer in an accident on a motorized scooter. He's taken time off since making his debut in January to rest the surgically repaired ankle. "He's coming back into his zone," Jackson said. "Everybody knew it was just a matter of time. He's starting to get comfortable, his ankle is starting to get healthy and that's what we need." Jason Kidd  recorded his second triple-double of the season with 21 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for the Mavericks, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. Kidd has 102 career triple-doubles, third on the list behind Oscar Robertson (181) and  Magic Johnson  (138). Dirk Nowitzki  had 27 points and  Jason Terry  added 20. "The Warriors outworked us, they outhustled us, they got all the loose balls, all the rebounds," Terry said. "When you are scrapping for your playoff lives, you cannot come out and put up a performance like that. We are disappointed, but we have one more game on this trip, and we need to find a way to get a win." The Warriors lost center  Andris Biedrins  to a sprained left ankle after eight minutes, but  Ronny Turiaf  had another big game in his place. The 6-foot-10 center grabbed a career-best 12 rebounds in 25 minutes and blocked five shots. "What a performance he had," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "When we needed him the most he delivered." Warriors guard  Corey Maggette  was also missing, out with a sinus infection. "Amazing things happen," Nelson said. "Two of our best players are out and we played a great game to beat a pretty darn good team." Brandan Wright  scored 12 points in 15 minutes in his return to the Warriors lineup after a 27-game layoff with a partial left shoulder separation. Turiaf's block of  Antoine Wright 's reverse layup attempt led to Jackson's 3-pointer that put Golden State up 74-62 midway through the third quarter. The momentum gave the Warriors an 89-78 lead entering the final quarter. They eventually led by as many as 15. "Our undoing tonight was our inability to stop defensive possessions with defensive rebounds," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. "They took 28 second-chance points and that will get you beat on the road most nights." The Mavericks are still in the eighth spot for the playoffs, but missed an opportunity to move into a seventh-place tie with the idle  Denver Nuggets . They fell 1 1/2 games back of Portland, New Orleans and Utah. Randolph helped spark a 15-4 run in the final 4:20 of the first half, scoring eight points, twice on slam dunks. Ellis added five points in the rally that gave the Warriors an eight-point edge before settling for a 60-54 halftime lead. Game notes  X-rays taken on Biedrins' ankle were negative. ...
