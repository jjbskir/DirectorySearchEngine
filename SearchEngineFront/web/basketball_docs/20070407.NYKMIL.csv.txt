MILWAUKEE -- With the game on the line, Isiah Thomas knew exactly where he needed  Eddy Curry : behind the 3-point line.

 Curry The Knicks-Bucks game in Milwaukee may not mean much when the story of the season has been writ, but for an unlikely finish to the fourth quarter, it would have to rank in the league's top ten for the season.
With the score tied, 99-99, and 0.9 seconds remaining, Milwaukee's Ruben Patterson made a three-point goal -- just his third of the season in 18 tries -- to take the lead. Undaunted, New York center Eddy Curry fired in a three-pointer from the corner with all the aplomb of Bruce Bowen. It was Curry's first three-point attempt in two seasons with the Knicks and only his second such attempt (he has made both of them) in his six seasons in the NBA. He finished with a career-high 43 points as the Knicks won in overtime, 118-113.

 Curry scored a career-high 43 points, including his first 3-pointer of the season to force overtime, and the  New York Knicks  beat the  Milwaukee Bucks  118-113 Saturday night. "He asked me if I had one in me and I said, 'Yeah," Curry said. "It felt good leaving my hand. [Dan] Gadzuric challenged the shot so I couldn't see the ball. So I stepped to the side and saw the ball go through. I really couldn't believe it, man. It was incredible." Added Thomas: "It was designed for Eddy. I didn't think that they would guard him. I've been telling him the whole season I was going to design a play for him to shoot a 3 and win a game for us. I took a timeout and said, 'Now's the time.' We drew it up and he knocked it down." Nate Robinson  matched a career high with 34 points for the Knicks, who snapped a four-game losing streak and remained three games behind eighth-place Orlando in the Eastern Conference. "They're fighting for their lives for a playoff spot," Milwaukee coach Larry Krystkowiak said. Milwaukee, which lost for the ninth time in 10 games, got 27 points and seven rebounds from  Ruben Patterson . He banked in a 3-pointer, his third of the season, to give Milwaukee a 102-99 lead with 0.9 seconds left. "That would've been a great time to go home and watch me on SportsCenter," Patterson said. "The shot clock was going down and I had a look. It don't make no doggone matter." Michael Redd , who missed the last two games with pain in his left knee, added 25 points. Curry shot 17-for-20 from the floor and added 13 rebounds for New York, which avoided its longest losing streak of the season. He had 25 points after halftime and topped his previous career high of 36 points, also against Milwaukee, on Dec. 9. "It was one of those nights where the shots were falling," Curry said. "My teammates did a good job looking for me." Robinson, who averages 9.1 points, added seven assists. Rookie  Mardy Collins  also notched a career high with 19 points. New York guard  Stephon Marbury  did not play because of a right turf toe injury sustained in a 12-minute performance Friday against Minnesota. Knicks guard  Steve Francis  missed his fifth straight game with a sprained right ankle. After Curry's shot from in front of New York's bench, the Knicks controlled overtime. They led the entire extra period and took their biggest lead of the game, 114-106, on a 3-pointer by Robinson with 1:15 left. "It's a tough loss," Patterson said. "They're still trying to play for that eighth spot in the playoffs and we're just out there having fun." In the third quarter, two free throws by Collins gave New York a 68-67 lead with 6:35 left, its first lead since 13-12 with 7:22 remaining in the first quarter.
