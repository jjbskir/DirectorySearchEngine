PHILADELPHIA -- New Jersey has become painfully familiar with watching other teams beat them in the final minutes. This time, it was  Andre Iguodala  and Philadelphia's turn. Elias Says The Nets lost another close one on Monday, dropping a 100-98 overtime decision to the 76ers. That's five losses by either one or two points for Lawrence Frank's team in its last nine games. Seven other teams in NBA history have lost five out of nine games by either a point or two, most recently the Grizzlies in December 2000.

Iguodala had 23 points, a career-high 15 assists, and seven rebounds in the 76ers' 100-98 overtime victory over New Jersey on Monday night, the Nets' second OT loss in two days. Samuel Dalembert  had 14 points and 17 rebounds, and  Andre Miller  had 18 points to give the Sixers their fifth win in eight games and sixth in 10. "We're turning it around," said  Kyle Korver , who scored nine points. "We're not winning as frequently as we'd like to, but we're doing so much better." The same can't be said for the Nets. One day after losing at the overtime buzzer against Atlanta, the Nets couldn't avoid another crunch time defeat. They did pull off a late-game thrill when  Eddie House 's 3-pointer with 7.8 seconds left in regulation sent the game into OT. But after  Clifford Robinson 's 3 gave them a 93-92 lead 2 minutes into the extra period, New Jersey went cold from the floor. Miller hit a running jumper for the lead, then Iguodala calmly sank a 3 with 1:06 left that gave the Sixers a needed cushion. Iguodala hit the clutch basket at the right time the Sixers needed to put away the Nets. "He's one of the most well-balanced players in the NBA and he's only in his third year," Korver said. The Nets didn't score again from the floor until  Vince Carter 's layup with 36 seconds to go pulled them within three, then  Jason Kidd  sank a pair of free throws that trimmed the lead to 99-98. Korver went 1-for-2 from the free throw line and set up one last chance for the Nets. Carter's 3-point heave was off the mark, sending New Jersey to its fourth straight loss. No, the 76ers didn't wildly celebrate at halfcourt like the Hawks did on Sunday when  Tyronn Lue  hit a 23-foot jumper at the buzzer to beat the Nets. But they've at least stopped playing like the worst team in basketball. "It's starting to get back to normal around here," said  Steven Hunter , who had 13 points. "Everyone's head is back to basketball. You can tell on the court we're focused on basketball and nothing else." Carter had 23 points and 10 rebounds, House scored 15 points and Kidd 14 for the Nets, who blew an 11-point third-quarter lead. "We have to work our way out of it," Carter said. "We have to work hard and hope things start breaking our way." Nearly everything is breaking the Sixers way of late. Maybe they'll get fewer ping-pong balls in the draft lottery, but the 76ers could create a sense of excitement about the future with some strong play in the rest of the second half. After a 10-0 run put the Sixers ahead by four with 2:45 left in the fourth, the Nets finally showed a spark. Carter banked in a layup and House hit a pullup jumper off the break that tied it at 84. Then Miller, who was been the unselfish, steadying influence at point guard the Sixers have badly needed, lobbed a perfect pass to Dalembert for the go-ahead alley-oop with 54 seconds to go. Missed free throws cost the Nets against the Hawks, and that troubling trend continued when Carter missed one of two from the line with 36 seconds left in regulation and could only pull the Nets within one. Joe Smith  seemed to give the Sixers a cushion with a leaning jumper and an 88-85 lead. But House hit a 3-pointer with 7.8 seconds left to tie it and force overtime. His right foot appeared to be on the arc and the three officials conferred before deciding the shot was a 3. "This is something that's not new," Kidd said. "We've been in this position a lot." And it's one the Nets need to get off if they want to make a serious run at the Atlantic Division title. Game notes  Hunter, a Chicago native and Bears fan, said he was never wearing his Rex Grossman jersey again. "He acted like he didn't know to play football," Hunter said. "We need to put him and Steve Bartman away." ... When the two teams last played in early December,  Richard Jefferson  and  Nenad Krstic  combined for 44 points for the Nets, and  Allen Iverson  and  Chris Webber  had 52 for the Sixers. Iverson and Webber are both gone, and Jefferson and Krstic are both out with injuries. ... Dalembert had his 13th double-double. ... The Sixers are 3-2 in overtime.
