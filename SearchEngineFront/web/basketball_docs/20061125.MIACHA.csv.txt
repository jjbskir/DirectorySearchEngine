CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Injuries have allowed  Dwyane Wade  to show another facet of his game: He's a great passer. Wade scored 35 points, 13 in the fourth quarter, and added 12 assists Saturday night as the  Miami Heat  beat the  Charlotte Bobcats  102-93.

 Wade Dwyane Wade had 33 points, five rebounds and 15 assists Friday night against Orlando and 35 points, six rebounds and 12 assists Saturday night at Charlotte. Since 1992-93, only one other NBA player had 30/5/10 (points/rebounds/assists) games on consecutive days: Kobe Bryant (Dec. 16-17, 2004). What Wade did on consecutive days is a phenomenal accomplishment when you consider the short list of players who have done that at least once in their career: Oscar Robertson, Dave Bing, Gail Goodrich, Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Reggie Theus, Michael Jordan, Michael Adams, Kobe Bryant, and now, Wade.

 Wade, forced to play a lot at point guard with  Jason Williams  and  Gary Payton  nursing injuries, has 27 assists in two games. "Now he can be a distributor and a facilitator," said Heat coach Pat Riley, who won his 400th game with Miami. "The ball can come back to him on the second option. I think he's beginning to understand that." Alonzo Mourning , back in the city where he began his NBA career, added 16 points on 8-of-9 shooting as Miami, coming in as the lowest-scoring team in the NBA, shot a season-high 55 percent to snap a three-game losing streak. "I made a point to the team prior to the game that about every week we get a win," Riley said. "So we got a win this week." Adam Morrison  matched a career high with 27 points for the Bobcats, who lost their second straight and fell to 1-8 all-time against Miami. Wade's 18-foot jumper put the Heat up 76-66 early in the fourth quarter. He followed his own miss and banked in a shot in the lane with 6:33 left, then on the next possession got up in the air and fed  Antoine Walker  for layup to give Miami an 88-77 lead. "I've been really trying to get my teammates confidence and hitting them in their sweet spots," Wade said. Wade, who a night earlier had a career-high 15 assists, made 10 of 14 shots and 15 of 22 free throws in his sixth game of 30 or more points this season. The number of free throw attempts drew the ire of Charlotte's  Gerald Wallace . "It's hard to guard anybody if you aren't allowed to touch him," Wallace said. "We're not allowed to touch the league's superstars." Walker, coming off the bench for the second straight game, had 16 points for Miami and shot 8-of-15. He had shot 4-for-19 in the previous three games. Mourning, selected by the Hornets with No. 2 overall pick in the 1992 draft, spent three seasons in Charlotte and hit the winning shot at the buzzer against Boston in 1993 to give the Hornets their first playoff series win in franchise history. Starting in place of the injured  Shaquille O'Neal , the 36-year-old's dunk started a 5-0 run to close the first half and give the Heat at 51-43 lead. The Bobcats rallied to tie the game on Wallace's alley-oop dunk midway through the third quarter. But Mourning scored on a goaltending call on the next possession and Miami built the lead to six entering the fourth. Mourning also held  Emeka Okafor  to nine points and 11 rebounds on 4-of-11 shooting in 30 foul-plagued minutes. "It's kind of difficult to fill Shaq's shoes," Mourning said. "( Michael Doleac ) and I have done a pretty good job of just clogging up the middle. We'll just try to tag team and hold that position down until he comes back." Morrison shot 9-for-20 and matched his career-high scoring total set in a win over San Antonio, but 10 points came after the game was decided. "I know I can play in this league. I know I can succeed in this league if I do it the right way," Morrison said. "Once the shots start falling, I'll feel a lot more comfortable offensively. But I know I belong out there." Williams was held to nine points and three assists on 2-of-11 shooting for the Heat after missing the previous two games with a sore knee. Payton did not score in seven minutes, but Wade picked up the slack. "When you get down to the bottom line, there was no answer for Dwyane Wade," Bobcats coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. "They put the ball in his hands and he will get or shot or he will get to the free throw line. We flat out didn't have answer for him." Game notes  Riley said O'Neal is coming along as well as could be expected after undergoing left knee surgery a week ago. "He's still sore. He's limping around, but he's getting therapy every day," Riley said. "I would imagine in another couple of weeks he'll start feeling better." O'Neal is expected to be sidelined for another month. ... Heat F  James Posey  worked out for about an hour Saturday morning, but missed his fifth straight game with a calf injury. ...
