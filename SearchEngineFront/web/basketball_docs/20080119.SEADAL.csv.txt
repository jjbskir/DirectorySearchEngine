DALLAS (AP) --  Kevin Durant  is learning NBA lessons the hard way. With the  Seattle SuperSonics  headed toward another lopsided loss, Durant forced up a wild 3-pointer early in the third quarter. Coach P.J. Carlesimo, having seen enough, quickly yanked the prized rookie out of the game. Just another rough moment in a difficult season for the young Seattle squad, which lost its 10th straight game, 111-96 to the  Dallas Mavericks  on Saturday night. "I took some bad shots," said Durant, who tied a season low with just six points. "I took a 3-pointer, and the coach told me to go to the basket. So I put it on myself that he took me out." Dirk Nowitzki  scored 20 points and  Devin Harris  keyed a game-breaking run in the second quarter for Dallas, which won for the eighth time in nine games. The Mavericks led by nine after one quarter and held a double-digit lead most of the game despite having not played since losing to Sacramento on Monday. "We came out and played pretty well," Mavericks forward  Josh Howard  said. "It was great to get back to a game. But we had the chance to work on things to get ready in case we make playoffs." Making the postseason seems like a crazy dream right now for the reeling Sonics. Seattle's 10 losses in a row matches the single-season franchise record. The Sonics (9-31) last dropped 10 in a row Dec. 12-29, 1968. The longest losing streak in Seattle history is 13 games. The Sonics lost five in a row to end the 2006-2007 season, then dropped eight more to start this season. It has been especially rocky the past three games, as the Sonics have lost by a combined 70 points. "Nobody wants to accept losing," Seattle's  Earl Watson  said. "But it's real. And it's not easy." Howard scored 17 points,  Jason Terry  added 15 and  Jerry Stackhouse  chipped in with 10 for the Mavericks. Wally Szczerbiak  scored 26 points and  Nick Collison  had 16 points and 12 rebounds for Seattle. Durant, who was playing his first pro game in the Lone Star State after starring last season at the University of Texas, shot 3-of-12. After his ill-advised 3-point attempt, Durant didn't return to the game until late in the fourth. "We were trying to keep a body on him," Mavericks coach  Avery Johnson  said. "The plan was to play him physical and get in his space." Seattle, which last won Dec. 29 against Minnesota, trailed 39-34 with 7:09 left in the first half before the Mavericks used a 27-10 run to build a 22-point halftime lead. The Mavericks hit 15 of 24 shots in the first quarter as they jumped out to a 33-24 lead. Seattle whittled the lead to five before Dallas seized control of the game. Harris drove for consecutive layups to put Dallas on top 54-38 with 3:24 remaining in the second quarter. Harris scored nine in the spurt and finished with 17 points. "In the second quarter we were awful defensively," Carlesimo said. "We dug ourselves a big hole during that stretch." Seattle's struggles were epitomized in the final sequence of the first half. With 2.7 seconds remaining,  Brandon Bass  hit a free throw but missed his second attempt. Bass picked up the rebound and hit a 15-foot jumper that gave the Mavericks a 66-44 advantage. The Mavericks mostly kept the lead over 20 points after halftime, though Seattle crept within 12 in the final two minutes after Dallas had cleared the bench. Besides the long skid, the Sonics have also lost nine straight road games and 12 in a row to the Mavericks. Seattle last beat Dallas on Dec. 9, 2004.
