 When he first took over for the fired  Byron Scott  on Thursday, he said the change was about a  New Orleans Hornets  team he believed could play better because he had assembled it as general manager. Yet, in the locker room after the Hornets' 110-102 win over the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Tuesday night, Bower's players wanted to make it about him, if only for the few moments it took to give him the game ball and a round of applause. "We've been through a lot here in the last couple of weeks and we're just showing him that we're trying as a team, as an organization, to turn everything around and that we appreciate everything that [he's] done," shooting guard  Devin Brown  said. "It's just Step 1. We've got a long way to go, but we're just telling him, 'Thank you.'" Bower had lost his first two games since taking on the dual role of GM and coach, and also lost  Chris Paul  to a left ankle injury that could keep the star point guard out for several weeks. Because of the timing of the coaching change, Bower did not hold his first full practice until Monday. "After everything that we put into it yesterday, it was great to come out and reward ourselves with a victory," Brown said. "I think guys felt a lot better after that practice. I think it showed tonight because we were able to move the ball around and we were knocking shots down." David West  had 24 points and 10 rebounds. With Paul out, point guards  Darren Collison  and  Bobby Brown  scored 12 apiece and combined for 11 assists as New Orleans snapped a three-game losing streak. Devin Brown had 16 points. Paul still managed an assist of sorts, organizing the postgame gesture of giving the game ball to Bower. "It made me feel good," Bower said. "They gave great effort and it was a pretty good night for us." New Orleans led by as much as 14 in the first half and never trailed after the first quarter. "Any time you give a team like that a big lead, especially on the road, it's going to be tough to come back," said Clippers center  Marcus Camby , who had 14 rebounds. "We dug ourselves in too deep of a hole to climb out of it. We weren't hitting shots that we normally make. I think that was pretty much the ballgame." Al Thornton  scored 30 points and former Hornets guard  Baron Davis  had 23 for the Clippers, who have lost four of five.  Chris Kaman  finished with 17 points,  Rasual Butler  had 12 and  Steve Novak  10. The Clippers also lost reserve guard  Kareem Rush , who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee when his leg buckled on a play in the first quarter. Peja Stojakovic  scored 15 points for New Orleans, hitting six free throws in the final minute to seal the win. Rookie reserve  Marcus Thornton  added 12 points and  Emeka Okafor  grabbed 14 rebounds. The Hornets enjoyed their largest lead at 95-79 when Thornton hit a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter. Los Angeles called timeout after the second one, then began to chip away at the deficit. Al Thornton scored two quick baskets on strong inside moves, the second as he was fouled. He and Davis combined for back-to-back driving layups later to pull Los Angeles to 97-88. After West's free throws, Davis, who was 7 of 21 shooting, hit his first 3 in eight tries. The Hornets finally stalled the Clippers' momentum when West tipped in  James Posey 's driving dunk attempt as it rattled out with 2:15 to go. West then added a jumper to make it 103-91. New Orleans outrebounded the Clippers 51-36 and outscored Los Angeles at the foul line, 28-17. Game notes  The Clippers have lost 11 straight to the Hornets in the regular season. ...
