ATLANTA --  LeBron James  dribbled at the top of the key with the clock winding down, then made his move. What happened next was a matter of debate. Al Horford  thought he played good defense. The officials decided otherwise. After the call went his way, James stepped to the line and made one free throw with 1.6 seconds remaining, just enough to give the Cavaliers their seventh win in eight games, 88-87 over the  Atlanta Hawks  on Sunday night.
