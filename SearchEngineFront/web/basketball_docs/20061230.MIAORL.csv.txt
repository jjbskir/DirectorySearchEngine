 The Heat scored only 14 points in the paint in its 97-68 loss to Orlando. It had been more than six years since Miami scored fewer points in the paint in one game. The team had 12 in a 90-73 loss at Detroit in April 2000.  For more Elias Says,  click here 
 
 
 Miami lost again without Wade and his 27 points per game, putting in two of its worst quarters of the season in a 97-68 loss to the  Orlando Magic  on Saturday night. Dwight Howard  had 18 points and 10 rebounds, helping Orlando own the paint with  Shaquille O'Neal  also out. The Magic outscored Miami inside 50-14, and commanded the game for all but the opening minutes. "They don't want to admit it in there, but we just got manhandled, absolutely manhandled on the boards, in the paint," Heat coach Pat Riley said. "Defensively, they were up and into us and we could never really get anything going at all." Orlando snapped a four-game losing streak and extended the Heat's skid to three games. Wade is resting a strained right wrist he injured Wednesday against the  Chicago Bulls , and O'Neal has missed more than 20 games with a knee injury. Neither traveled to Orlando, and  Jason Williams  didn't play because he was resting from the Friday game against the Nets. Riley said he'd know more about Wade's status Sunday. Miami is 0-4 this season without him. Jason Kapono  had 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting for the Heat, while  Dorell Wright  scored 12. Wright came off the bench after starting 18 straight games. The Heat scored a season-low 10 second-quarter points, and went nearly eight minutes without a point in the period. The Magic scored only 12 in that span, but it was enough to help them take a 48-37 halftime lead. Miami scored only 11 points in the fourth, and had season lows in field goals (23) and shooting percentage (34 percent). "Teams know that we don't have a loaded gun and they are taking advantage of that,"  Alonzo Mourning  said. "They are really sticking it to us. I am not going to forget it and my teammates are sure not going to forget it. We are going to see them again." Trevor Ariza  had 16 points and 10 rebounds, including an impressive dunk over Mourning in the third quarter.  Tony Battie  had 12 points and six rebounds,  Hedo Turkoglu  scored 11 points and  Jameer Nelson  had seven assists. The Magic were without  Grant Hill , who sometimes rests the second of back-to-back games, and  Keyon Dooling , who scored 20 points Friday night. Magic coach Brian Hill said neither injury was serious. Orlando's win came a night after the Magic lost the Southeast Division lead to Washington in Friday's one-point defeat to the Wizards. Orlando, which previously had one of the East's best records, improved to 18-14, while Miami fell to 13-17. "The first thing Coach said in the meeting today was that you've got to stop it right here. We came out today with the energy and the focus to get it done," Howard said. Game notes  Magic rookie  J.J. Redick  entered the game to loud applause in the third quarter. He had nine points in 12 minutes. ... Orlando had another dismal night from the 3-point line. The Magic were 4-for-13, compared with 7-for-16 for Miami.
