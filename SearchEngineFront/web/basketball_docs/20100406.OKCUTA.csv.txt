SALT LAKE CITY --  Deron Williams  set his career high for points, then was able to celebrate when the Jazz were finally able to stop  Kevin Durant . Williams' jumper with 1.1 seconds left in overtime gave Utah a one-point lead and  C.J. Miles  clinched it with a disputed block on Durant's shot at the buzzer in a 140-139 win over the  Oklahoma City Thunder  on Tuesday night.

Just when it seemed the Thunder had erased every reason to doubt they can win a playoff series, they got served a big reminder of why they likely won't get past the first round: They won't get the calls from the officials, writes J.A. Adande.  Daily Dime 
 
 
 The Jazz pulled into second place in the Western Conference standings and ended the Thunder's four-game winning streak, which has Oklahoma City also contending with Utah and Denver for the Northwest Division title. "It was a huge win for us because they were right on our heels," said Williams, who finished with 42 points and 10 assists. Carlos Boozer  had 28 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz, who hadn't scored 140 in almost 20 years. Durant finished with 45 points as the Thunder and Jazz combined for the highest-scoring game in the NBA this season, according to STATS LLC. "Great game. Classic," Boozer said. "Both teams scrambled for balls on the floor, hustled on defense, fought for rebounds. I mean, it was like a playoff game and I'm proud of us coming with that W." Durant thought he was fouled on a 3-pointer just before the buzzer that would have won it for the Thunder. He and several teammates stayed on the court pleading for a call that never came before the officials were escorted to the tunnel by security. Miles appeared to get a piece of the ball -- and the Thunder thought he got some of Durant, too.

 "The referee didn't call a foul. You have to go with him. He had a better look than I had," Oklahoma City coach  Scott Brooks  said. "Sometimes you get those. Sometimes you don't. We had a good opportunity to win the game. We didn't get a stop. That's the bottom line." The Jazz entered tied with Dallas, Denver and Phoenix in the Western Conference and managed to move ahead with a thrilling win over the Thunder, who were going for a four-game sweep of Utah this season. It was the most points the Jazz have scored since getting 141 against Denver on Dec. 13, 1990. Utah won its 10th straight at home. Even after falling behind by 13 in the fourth quarter, Oklahoma City came very close to completing the sweep. Durant brought the Thunder back with four of his seven 3-pointers in the fourth as Oklahoma City rallied to force overtime. Russell Westbrook  finished with 27 points and nine assists and  Jeff Green  scored 20 for the Thunder, including the go-ahead layup with 5 seconds left in OT. After Williams hit a 3-pointer to break a 135-all tie with 49 seconds left, Durant drew a foul and made both free throws with 43 seconds remaining. Then the Thunder got a rebound when Williams missed a jumper with 14.5 seconds left. After a timeout, Utah's C.J. Miles almost pressured Durant into a turnover, but he was able to flip the ball to Green, who drove for a layup that put Oklahoma City back up 139-138. Utah called timeout and set up a play for Williams, who swished his shot from the top of the key with 1.1 seconds left. "Deron is always focused. I don't think there's a game he's not focused," Boozer said. "He played great tonight." Jazz fans chanted "M-V-P! M-V-P!" during a timeout called by the Thunder and continued cheering through the ending. The Thunder got the inbounds pass to Durant, who tried a turnaround jumper from far outside the 3-point line and was way short. Durant argued for a foul until Oklahoma City's coaching staff led him and the other Thunder players from the court as confetti dropped from the rafters. "I just tried to make a play on the ball and get out of there," Miles said. "He's a threat every time he has the ball. He's one of the most talented scorers in the league."
