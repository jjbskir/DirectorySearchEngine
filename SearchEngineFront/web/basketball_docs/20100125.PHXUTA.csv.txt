SALT LAKE CITY -- After getting staggered by an amazing run
of 3-pointers, the  Utah Jazz  put on a rally that had even
curmudgeonly coach Jerry Sloan almost cracking a smile.       The Jazz scored the final 12 points of the third quarter, then
dominated the fourth in a 124-115 win over the  Phoenix Suns  on
Monday, continuing Utah's run up the Western Conference standings.       "We were a little bit more alive defensively," Sloan said. "I
haven't seen that for a while. I've kind of felt it coming, but I
haven't seen it like that where they stuck together and where they
really worked hard to try to help each other defend."       The defense led to offense as Utah rolled up 33 points on the
Suns in the final period and controlled the boards 17-6.        Carlos Boozer  finished with 21 points and 20 rebounds and rookie
 Wesley Matthews  scored 10 of his career-high 21 points in the
fourth quarter as the Utah Jazz rallied for their eighth win in 10
games.        Andrei Kirilenko  had 25 points, six rebounds and three blocks
and  Deron Williams  finished with 18 points and 11 assists for Utah.
 Mehmet Okur  and  Paul Millsap  had 12 points apiece for the Jazz.       "The way we came back and hung in there, it was just a great
team effort," Williams said. "We're definitely playing our best
basketball right now."        Steve Nash  had 15 points and 15 assists, giving him 8,013 in his
career and making him the eighth player in NBA history to surpass
8,000 assists.        Goran Dragic  scored a career high for the second straight game
with 32 and  Channing Frye  added 21 points for Phoenix, which made
17 of 30 from beyond the 3-point arc.       Phoenix scored 45 in the second quarter, but couldn't maintain
that pace and once the 3-pointers stopped falling, Utah was able to
rally.       "We were up 17. We've got to be able to maintain that,"
Phoenix coach Alvin Gentry said.       The Jazz outrebounded the Suns 48-31 and used a 12-0 run at the
end of the third quarter to get back in it, then pulled away in the
fourth.       "We just couldn't get into our offense," Nash said. "They
pushed us out. We had no penetration and we were just jacking up
jump shots or turning it over."       The Suns continued to surge late in the third quarter as Nash
hit a 3-pointer to put Phoenix up 93-77. After a layup by Boozer,
Frye hit another 3 and the Suns led 96-79.       Utah was finally able to make a legitimate run after that,
scoring the last 12 points of the third to get to 96-91 entering
the fourth, which Kirilenko opened with a dunk.       "We just felt like we had the momentum," Williams said. "We
just felt it shifted. We were able to get it to like four or five
and you could just see them hanging their heads a little bit."       The Jazz finally tied it on Matthews' 3-pointer with 7:59 left
in the game, but Dragic answered right back for the Suns eight
seconds later with another 3 to put Phoenix up 103-100.       Frye added another 3-pointer with 6:48 left that gave the Suns a
106-102 lead, but the Jazz took over from there.       Boozer knocked down a 20-foot jumper, Matthews hit two free
throws to tie it at 106 and then Kirilenko made two more foul shots
with 5:16 left to put the Jazz up 108-106 -- Utah's first lead since
the first quarter.       Matthews hit another 3, which Dragic quickly matched for the
Suns, but Millsap hit a baseline jumper Matthews made two foul
shots after making a steal, Boozer hit two more from the line and
Millsap added an 18-foot jumper. Nash drove for a layup to cut the
lead to 119-111, but Williams answered that with a 3-pointer with
1:56 left and the Jazz had just about wrapped it up. Game notes  It was Boozer's fifth career game with 20 points and 20
rebounds. ... Nash needed just two assists to reach 8,000. ... The
Jazz shot 37 foul shots to Phoenix's 23. ... The 124 points was a
season high for the Jazz. ... Dragic's previous career high was 20
scored Saturday against Golden State.
