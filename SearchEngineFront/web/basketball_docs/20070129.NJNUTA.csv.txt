SALT LAKE CITY -- With a five-game road trip finally about to end,  Vince Carter  had a choice between trying to extend it another few minutes or take a shot at ending it from 35 feet away. Carter opted against the overtime and beat the buzzer and the  Utah Jazz  with a 3-pointer that gave New Jersey a 116-115 win Monday, ending a trip that started miserably with consecutive wins. Elias Says The Nets won by one point Monday in Utah 116-115. Before beating the Nuggets by 10 points on Saturday, the Nets had lost three straight games by a single point (tying an NBA record in the process), and they also beat the Knicks by the minimum margin on Jan. 19, so the Nets have played a one-point game in four of their last five games and in five of their last seven.

Carter got the shot off, watched it go in and then waved goodbye to the Jazz bench before he was tackled by the rest of the Nets, who began their Western swing with three consecutive one-point losses. "I knew that (Jason) Kidd was fast with the ball, but he's even faster without the ball. By the time I turned around he was right up on me," Carter said. Kidd finished with 22 points and 10 assists, including five in the second half. He scored 16 in the second quarter to carry the Nets, then Carter took over with 13 points in the third and outscored Utah 5-1 in the last 6 seconds. Carter's dunk got the Nets within 114-113, then  Deron Williams  went 1-for-2 from the line for the Jazz with 5 seconds left. Carter didn't mess around with trying to tie it, pulling up well outside the arc and nailing the shot as if it were a free throw. "You know, games have been funny," Kidd said. "We've lost three games in a row at the buzzer and now our last game on the road against a talented team in Utah that we win." Mehmet Okur  led the Jazz with 18 points, 11 rebounds and had five assists.  Paul Millsap  finished with 16 points and 12 boards. Utah was playing without leading scorer and rebounder  Carlos Boozer  (knee) and coach Jerry Sloan, who missed the game with the flu. "It's tough. Those are tough games," said Phil Johnson, who took over for Sloan. "You can look at all those we've lost (at the buzzer), but we've won an awful lot of games, particularly early in the year. Maybe it's evening out on us." Utah outrebounded New Jersey 44-21, but the Jazz couldn't close it out after taking a 114-110 lead on back-to-back baskets by  Andrei Kirilenko  and Williams with a little more than a minute to play. Mikki Moore  was 1-for-2 from the line for the Nets, and Okur and Williams missed jumpers on Utah's next two possessions. Carter pulled down the rebound after Williams' miss and called timeout with 11 seconds left. He leaped through the lane untouched for a dunk that got the Nets within 114-113 with six seconds to go. Williams missed a free throw and left the Nets the opportunity to finish off the road trip with a thrilling win. "The basketball gods had to shine on us some time," Carter said. Carter finished 10-for-15 and  Eddie House  went 7-for-13 while scoring 19 for the Nets.  Marcus Williams  and  Antoine Wright  scored 12 each.  Derek Fisher  had 17 points for Utah.
