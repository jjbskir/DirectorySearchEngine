INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Once the  Indiana Pacers  started passing to each other instead of to the  Golden State Warriors , they were unstoppable. The Pacers had 22 turnovers in the first three quarters, but two in the fourth. Their improved ball security helped them overcome a 17-point second-half deficit and beat the Warriors 125-117 on Wednesday night. The Pacers' point total was a season high, and their 46 points in the fourth quarter tied their season high. "To score 46 points in a quarter, especially in the decisive quarter, and to win the game -- that's probably one of our best quarters this year," said  Danny Granger , who led the Pacers with 29 points. Indiana went 17-for-17 from the free-throw line in the final quarter while Golden State went 4-for-11. The Pacers went 36-for-38 from the line overall, and outrebounded the Warriors 55-35. Golden State coach Don Nelson was impressed with Indiana's comeback, and he hoped his team learned from it. "I thought they were sensational," he said. "We've been winning games like this. Maybe we've been fooling people for a long time that it's going to happen all year, but you know it's not." Golden State set an NBA record for steals in a quarter with 12 in the opening period. The Warriors led 29-18 at the end of the quarter. "The way we started the game was miserable," Indiana's  Mike Dunleavy  said. "They [Golden State] can get up big, but they can also let you back in it. We just hung tight, we just stuck together." The Pacers completed the comeback short-handed. Point guard  Jamaal Tinsley  sat out with a sore left knee and center  Jermaine O'Neal  left the game in the first quarter with a sore left knee and did not return. Dunleavy had 24 points and nine rebounds against his former team, and  Kareem Rush  scored 14 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter for the Pacers. Baron Davis  had 24 points, seven assists, seven steals and six rebounds,  Al Harrington  had 22 points and  Stephen Jackson  had 17 points and eight assists for the Warriors. The Pacers acquired Dunleavy from Golden State for Harrington and Jackson last season. Golden State led by as many as 15 points in the second quarter, but that margin was cut to four by halftime. "We didn't put our feet on their necks and finish the game in the first half," Jackson said. "We let them stay around." The Pacers stopped Golden State's winning streak at three games. Golden State led 93-79 at the end of the third quarter, but the Warriors went cold to start the final period. Granger scored nine points in the first three minutes of the fourth quarter as part of a 13-3 run that cut the lead to 96-92. The Pacers finally took the lead, 101-98, on a 3-pointer by Dunleavy with 6:33 to play. Golden State's  Matt Barnes  was called for a flagrant foul with four minutes to go for impeding Dunleavy on a drive to the basket. Dunleavy made both free throws, then a layup on the extra possession, to give Indiana a 107-101 lead. Golden State cut the lead to 115-114 on a dunk by  Andris Biedrins , but Rush hit a short jumper on the other end with 43 seconds to play. Jackson missed a 3-pointer at the other end, and Davis fouled Granger on the rebound, his sixth. Granger made both free throws to make it 119-114. Rush made 4 of 4 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. "I'm happy the way we fought back and persevered through the game," he said. "That fourth quarter, a lot of guys came in and made shots." The game was a reversal of the meeting between the teams Sunday in Oakland, when the Pacers got a big lead, but the Warriors came back to win, 106-101. "Seems to me that's about the scenario when we played them at our place," Nelson said. "We were lucky to win that game. Tonight, I don't think they were lucky. They were better than us."
