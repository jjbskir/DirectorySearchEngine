SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- After some of the comebacks the  Utah Jazz 
have had this season, seven points was nothing. The Jazz rallied again, outscoring the  Los Angeles Lakers  by 12
in the final quarter and winning 114-108 Friday night to improve to
an NBA-best 12-1. Utah held  Kobe Bryant  to just two points in the final quarter
and outrebounded the Lakers 16-4 in the fourth while winning its
eighth straight. "They made their run, they got us down a little bit. We just
fought back and took the game over," said  Deron Williams , who
scored 11 of his 15 points in the final quarter. Carlos Boozer  had 31 points and 16 rebounds and  Andrei Kirilenko 
blocked five shots in his first game back after missing five with a
sprained ankle. Bryant scored 27, but he went 0-for-3 in the fourth with
Kirilenko guarding him much of the time. "Here's a situation where Andrei Kirilenko had four points in
the ballgame and he was instrumental in us winning," Jazz coach
Jerry Sloan said. "There's no question about that. He was
terrific." In their previous three games, the Jazz needed to rally from 16
points down twice and 21 points once to win. So the Lakers' 89-82
lead early in the fourth quarter didn't seem like much at all. Utah outscored the Lakers 32-20 in the final period, closing
with a 7-1 run which Boozer punctuated by grabbing an offensive
rebound and putting it back in with 8.7 seconds left to put it out
of reach. Lamar Odom  finished with 26 for the Lakers, who had won four in
a row. He was also the Lakers' top rebounder with six. The Lakers were just 6-for-17 from the floor in the fourth
quarter. After making all five of their 3-point attempts in the
third, the Lakers cooled off in the fourth and couldn't overcome
Utah's huge advantage on the boards. Utah outrebounded Los Angeles 45-27 and outscored the Lakers
23-9 on second-chance points. "I told them they had nothing to be ashamed of except that
rebound total when they look at it," Lakers coach Phil Jackson
said. Mehmet Okur  also had a double-double for Utah with 18 points and
12 rebounds.  Derek Fisher  scored 13 against his former team, Gordan
Giricek added 12 points and  Matt Harpring  scored 10. Kwame Brown  scored 15 and  Luke Walton  finished with 13 points
for the Lakers. Williams also had 10 assists and led the Jazz back after they
fell behind by seven early in the fourth quarter. "They're just playing extremely well," Bryant said. Williams grabbed a loose ball after getting blocked by Smush
Parker and made a 22-footer to put Utah ahead 107-104. Then after
Odom converted a three-point play to tie it with 1:18 left,
Williams hit a 3-pointer with a minute left. "He made some big plays," Boozer said. "He had a tough game
going for him and he didn't think about it." Odom missed on a 3-pointer and the rebound bounced to Williams,
who made both his free throws with 38 seconds left. After a free
throw by Odom, Boozer put back the offensive board to cap it. Game notes Kirilenko had his 19th block of the season two minutes into
the game when Odom tried to drive on him. Kirilenko had two more
blocks in the quarter. ... After opening the game 22-for-25 from
the line, the Lakers were 8-for-12 on free throws in the fourth
quarter. ... Okur, Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis and Sloan all
received technical fouls.
