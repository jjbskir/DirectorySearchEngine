TORONTO --  Jarrett Jack  lifted the Trail Blazers to a road
win without  Zach Randolph .
 
 Elias Says 
  No. 1 met No. 2 for the first time in the Trail Blazers' 93-83 win at Toronto. Andrea Bargnani, the first pick in the 2006 NBA draft, scored eight points for the Raptors; No. 2 pick LaMarcus Aldridge scored three points for the Blazers. It was only the fourth time in NBA history -- but the second season in a row -- that both players were held to single-digit scoring in the first meeting of the top two picks. The other such matchups: Andrew Bogut vs. Marvin Williams (2005 draft), Kwame Brown vs. Tyson Chandler (2001), and Cazzie Russell vs. Dave Bing (1966).

assists and Portland won without the suspended Randolph, 93-83 over
the  Toronto Raptors  on Sunday.
 

    Martell Webster  added 22 points and eight rebounds for the Trail
Blazers, who won for just the second time in nine games.
 

   Randolph made an obscene gesture to Pacers fans in Indiana on
Friday and Blazers management responded by suspending him for one
game and fining him.  LaMarcus Aldridge , the No. 2 pick in the
draft, started in place of Randolph and had three points and three
rebounds.
 

   Jack said with a smile that his teammates didn't tell him early
enough that he was close to a triple double.
 

   "They didn't tell me that I needed two assists and a rebound
until maybe a minute to go. It's kind of tough to try to get it,
but I'm more than happy with the win," Jack said.
 

   Portland coach Nate McMillan met with Jack before the game and
told him he didn't want anybody trying to match what Randolph does.
 

   "I talked to him about leadership. With Zach not being here
today we really needed him to take control and take over as a
leader," McMillan said. "He was the guy who set the tone for us
from the start."
 

   Jack called his performance terrible after he had five turnovers
and just six points in Friday's loss. He rebounded against Toronto
-- making his first seven shots and finishing 9-for-15 from the
field. The second-year point guard had 30 points and 10 assists in
a victory over Milwaukee on Wednesday before struggling against
Indiana.
 

   "He played great and he's been great. He's making a name for
himself in this league," Webster said.
 

   Toronto All-Star  Chris Bosh  missed Sunday's game and will miss
two more games because of a bruised left knee. Bosh did not make
the trip to Florida, where the Raptors play in Miami on Monday
night and in Orlando on Wednesday night.
 

    Andrea Bargnani , the No. 1 pick in the draft, replaced Bosh and
had eight points and three rebounds in his first start.
 

    Morris Peterson  had 23 points for the Raptors, who were
outrebounded 56-34 without Bosh, who's third in the NBA in
rebounding.
 

   "We couldn't rebound," Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said.
 

   The Raptors, who have lost three straight, lacked energy and
shot just 35 percent.
 

   "This was a game we should have won. We should have come out
and had more energy," Toronto point guard  T.J. Ford  said. "They
just outplayed us and outworked us."
 

   Fans booed after Portland's  Jamaal Magloire  made two free throws
to give the Trail Blazers a 15-point lead with just over four
minutes left.
 

   Toronto cut the lead to seven with less than two minutes left,
but  Juan Dixon  made two free throws with 52.1 seconds remaining.
Peterson followed with a 22-foot-jumper with 47.8 seconds left, but
Webster made two more from the line.
 

   After Toronto's T.J. Ford made a 3-pointer, Jack made two free
throws to make it 91-83 with 41 seconds left.
 

   Dixon finished with 16 points.
 

   Jack scored 12 points in the first quarter and Webster had 11 in
the second quarter as Portland led 50-41 at halftime.
