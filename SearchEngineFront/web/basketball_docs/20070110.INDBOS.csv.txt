BOSTON (AP) -- The  Indiana Pacers  finally have a three-game
winning streak. Jermaine O'Neal  scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half
and  Jamaal Tinsley  added 17 points and 13 assists to help the
Indiana Pacers beat the short-handed  Boston Celtics  97-84 on
Wednesday night. Danny Granger  scored 16 points and  Stephen Jackson  added 15 for
the Pacers, who outscored Boston 45-32 in the second half to win
their fifth of six road games. Indiana had won two straight seven
times until this stretch. After Boston used a 14-0 run to pull with four points late in
the fourth quarter, the Pacers scored 13 straight to pull away for
good. "It was a great sign that we withheld from going in the tank
when those guys made their run," said O'Neal, who scored five
during that final stretch. "I think it was a great sign, but we
still have a lot of work to do to establish ourself as a
competitive team." Tony Allen  scored 19 points for Boston before leaving with an
injured left knee with 3:01 remaining in the third quarter. A few moments after Jackson was called for a foul, Allen went up
for a free dunk and landed awkwardly, writhing in pain for several
minutes until his teammates carried him off the court. Allen was taken to New England Baptist Hospital for an MRI. "This is just terrible," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. "When
he came down, you could see his heel jam into the ground and I
reacted right away because I could see it, I could feel it" Rivers said Allen's injury is probably an ACL tear, but the MRI
results won't be available until Thursday. "Everybody sees the player that Tony is, but he's more than
that to us," Celtics guard  Sebastian Telfair  said. "Going to see
him down was like seeing Superman beat up. It don't feel right." Rajon Rondo  followed the injury with a free throw to pull Boston
to within 68-64, but the Pacers closed the quarter on a 12-2 run to
pull away. O'Neal then scored four straight to open the fourth quarter,
pushing Indiana's lead to 82-66. "(Allen) was playing really well, keeping them in the game,"
Jackson said. "When he got hurt, it kind of slowed them down,
killed their momentum and they didn't really have a go-to guy. I
wish him the best and from the Pacers to him, we're going to pray
for him. We never wish that on nobody." Telfair had 15 points and  Gerald Green  added 14 for the Celtics,
who have lost nine of 11. O'Neal was held to six points on 3-of-6 shooting in the first
half as the teams entered the break tied at 52. But he scored eight
points in the third quarter to help Indiana outscore Boston 28-14. The Pacers used third-quarter runs of 9-0 and 8-0 to take
control. After  Kendrick Perkins ' layup put the Celtics up 60-57
with 8:07 left in the third,  Al Harrington  and Tinsley hit
back-to-back 3-pointers to give Indiana the lead for good. Boston scored 14 straight to pull to within 84-80 with 4:27
left, but Granger responded with a 3-pointer the next time down the
floor to start a 13-0 run and avoid another collapse by the Pacers.
Indiana was outscored 28-18 in the fourth quarter of a 100-91 loss
to Dallas on Jan. 4. The Pacers will go for four straight against the Mavericks on
Friday. Boston, meanwhile, just hopes to have enough healthy players
when they host Toronto on Friday. Forward  Brian Scalabrine  left in the second quarter with an
injured right knee and didn't return. He also went to New England
Baptist Hospital for an MRI. Before the game, the Celtics announced forward  Wally Szczerbiak 
would miss at least a week because of recurring ankle injuries.
 Delonte West  also sat out with a sore back, joining  Paul Pierce  and
 Theo Ratliff  on the bench. Pierce has been out since Dec. 20 with a stress reaction in his
left foot, while Ratliff will miss the remainder of the season with
a sore back. "Everybody just seems to be falling like dominoes," Green
said. "We just got to stick together and keep on playing.
Hopefully we get guys back in a couple weeks and we'll get some
guys under our belts." Game notes Harrington was 0-for-4 in the first half and finished with
seven points on 1-of-10 shooting. ... The Celtics shot 61 percent
from the field, but just 41 percent for the game. The Celtics
committed 22 turnovers. ... The Celtics have used 11 starting
lineups.
