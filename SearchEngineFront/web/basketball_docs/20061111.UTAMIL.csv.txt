MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The best night in  Milwaukee Bucks  franchise
history was not enough for a win. Michael Redd  scored 57 points to break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
franchise record, but  Matt Harpring  made a layup with 1.8 seconds
left to give the  Utah Jazz  a 113-111 victory over the Bucks on
Saturday night.

 Redd Michael Redd scored 57 points in Milwaukee's 113-111 loss to Utah. It was the most points scored by a player in a game his team lost since Michael Jordan scored 64 points for the Bulls in an overtime loss to Orlando in Jan. 1993. The last player to score that many points in a non-overtime loss was also Jordan (April 1987, 61 points vs. Atlanta). The NBA record for most points by a player in a regulation loss is 73 by Denver's David Thompson on April 9, 1978 (139-137 loss at Detroit). 
 
Redd did not record an assist in Saturday's game. Only two players in the last 40 years scored 57 or more points in a game in which they did not have an assist: Golden State's Purvis Short in Nov. 1984 (59 points, 0 assists) and Kobe Bryant in Dec. 2005 (62 points, 0 assists).

"I will probably just go home and thank God," Redd said. "A
second-round pick, a guy that didn't know if he was going to make
the team or not, to this. I am just grateful. I can't describe it. "But I wanted to win. That's the main thing. It probably would
have felt better if I would have won the game." The Bucks almost did, as Redd's 39-point second half helped
erase a 24-point, first-half deficit. But  Carlos Boozer  scored 32 points and  Deron Williams  had 27
points and a career-high 15 assists to help the Jazz move to 6-1
for just the fifth time in franchise history. The Bucks dropped their fourth straight to fall to 2-5, their
worst start since 2000-01. Redd broke the franchise scoring record of 55 set by
Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA's career scoring leader, against the Boston
Celtics on Dec. 10, 1971. Redd made 18 of 32 field goals, going 6-of-12 from 3-point range
and 15-of-17 on free throws. It was Redd's first career 50-point game and sixth career
40-point night. He has scored at least 30 points in four of seven
games this season. Redd's previous career high of 43 points came in a 116-103
season-ending loss to Washington last April 18. Redd said he has never scored 57 at any level. He said he once
scored 56 in an AAU game in high school. "At first I thought it might be a difficult night because I
knew they would hone on me," Redd said. "I had no intentions of
trying to come in and score 57 points, just play basketball and see
what happened. It happened. "A lot of shots were going in, I don't know how." The Jazz dominated much of the game, but saw their big lead
evaporate in the fourth quarter behind Redd's 25 points in the
period -- including 11 in the first 2  minutes of the quarter. Utah still led 109-102 with less than two minutes left, but
 Ruben Patterson  hit two free throws to cut the lead to five with
1:08 remaining.  Andrew Bogut 's dunk and free throw made it 109-107
with 39 seconds left. Williams then missed a 3-pointer on the other end, and Redd was
fouled on the rebound but missed the first of two free throws with
12 seconds left to keep it 109-108. Redd then fouled Boozer on the inbounds play, and he made both
free throws to put Utah up three with 11 seconds remaining. Redd
then curled off a screen and nailed a 3-pointer from the right wing
with 6.9 seconds left to tie it. Williams, however, dribbled quickly down the floor and found
Harpring cutting on the baseline for a layup with 1.8 seconds left. "I saw an opening and got a great pass," Harpring said. "I
knew I had a back door, caught eyes with D-Williams and he made a
great pass." Redd missed a fadeaway 27-footer at the buzzer. "I thought I was going to make it, actually," Redd said. "It
felt good, and it just went off to the side." It was not all good news for the Jazz, who lost forward Andrei
Kirilenko to what the team called a severely sprained right ankle
midway through the second quarter. Kirilenko, who was in a walking
boot after the game, appeared to roll the ankle while vying for a
loose ball on the left sideline with Milwaukee's  Ersan Ilyasova . Williams, a second-year player, continued his solid play. He had
18 points in the first half -- including his first 3-pointer of the
season -- one night after sinking 10 of 15 shots and scoring 26
points in a win over the Celtics. Williams had 14 assists Friday. Boozer scored 14 points in the third quarter en route to a
season high. But the story was Redd, who outscored all of his teammates,
57-54. "You know, I've seen  Michael Jordan  and those guys do that,
but, Michael Redd, he's just sensational," Utah coach Jerry Sloan
said. "I'd say tonight is right up there at the top with any of
them in that situation. He brought his team back and gave them
life, and they knew they had an opportunity to win." Utah was in control early, taking advantage of a porous Bucks
defense for a series of layups and dunks, as fans booed. The Jazz
almost put the game out of reach early in the second quarter with a
16-0 run before Redd's charge. "We didn't win the game," Bogut said. "(Redd) played a great
game individually, but I am sure he would much rather score 20
points and get a win. He would much rather get a 'W' than have
someone score 60." Patterson made his first seven shots and finished with 18
points. Utah rookie Paul Millsap had a career-high 15 points and
Harpring had 17. Game notes The Jazz have won four straight games against Milwaukee and
seven of nine. ... Redd has scored in double digits in 87 straight
games, the fifth-longest streak in team history. Abdul-Jabbar holds
the team record. He scored in double digits in all 467 games he
played with the Bucks. ... Besides his 55-point effort in 1971,
Abdul-Jabbar also scored 53 points four times in a Milwaukee
uniform.
