ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The  Orlando Magic  have been the best road team in the NBA this season, but the  Indiana Pacers  might be headed in that direction. Danny Granger  poured in a season-high 27 points and the Pacers rallied from a 15-point second half deficit to beat Orlando 115-109 on Friday night. It was Indiana's fifth win in its last six road games, including four against Western Conference opponents. The Pacers put seven players in double figures, including 20 from  Jamaal Tinsley , 15 from  Jermaine O'Neal  and 13 from reserve guard  Marquis Daniels . "Winning on the road is the first step toward being a good team in this league," Granger said. "And rallying from 15 points against a team like Orlando is a really good sign. We didn't do anything fancy. We just stayed with it, forced them into turnovers and hit some shots." Tinsley directed the comeback, scoring 14 of his 20 points and handing six of his 10 assists in the second half. He scored seven straight points and had two assists during a 14-1 run in the middle of the fourth quarter that put Indiana in control. "Jamaal is making big plays on a pretty regular basis," Indiana coach Jim O'Brien said. "He pretty much orchestrated the whole thing. He knew exactly what we wanted down the stretch and did a great job of getting guys to the right spot to make plays." The Magic, playing at home for the first time after winning four of five games on a West Coast trip, lived and died behind the 3-point line. Orlando hit seven of 17 treys in taking a 62-54 halftime lead, but only 5-of-18 during a forgettable second-half collapse. The Magic also turned it over 23 times and allowed the Pacers to shoot 48.8 percent in the second half.  Dwight Howard  led Orlando with 30 points and 15 rebounds and  Rashard Lewis  contributed 24 points, but neither could stop the bleeding. "Our shooting was bad in the second half, but we lost the game at the defensive end of the floor," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "We were awful defensively. We got totally outplayed. "These are some of the same problems we had on the [West Coast] trip, but we shot our way out of it. Tonight, we couldn't shoot our way out of it." Game notes  Tinsley had 10-plus assists for the ninth time in the last 11 games. ... The Magic are averaging nearly 10 points more per game this season -- 104.5 to 94.8 -- than they last season. ... Orlando leads the NBA in 3-pointers made with 197 this season. ... Howard leads the NBA with 17 double-doubles this season. ... Indiana had held its last seven opponents to 30.7 percent shooting from 3-point territory.
