 "I had the whole repertoire working," Wade said. "I enjoy passing the ball, having high assists. But it seems now and then, I need to show what I can do when my team needs me." He hit 14-of-22 field goals, including 2-of-3 3-pointers, and converted 13-of-17 free throws. His effort was just one shy of his season high on Jan. 6 at home against Boston. He also grabbed nine rebounds and dished out six assists in 44 minutes. Wade hit back-to-back 3-pointers to lift the Heat to a 101-93 lead with 1:17 left in overtime. "Those two 3s were a dagger at the end," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "Wade showed us why he's one of the top three players in the league. He's a superb clutch basketball player that single-handedly won the game for them." Michael Beasley  added 12 points,  Dorell Wright  11 and  Mario Chalmers  10 for Miami, which has won five straight on the road. Troy Murphy  had 29 points and 15 rebounds, and  Danny Granger  scored 25 for Indiana.  Solomon Jones  added 13 and  Brandon Rush  10. Miami snapped the Pacers' eight-game home winning streak and completed its first sweep in the 22-year history of the series. "We couldn't get it done at the end when it really counted," Murphy said. "When they needed it, Dwyane Wade took the game over, and that was the end." After Wade fell while trying to dribble around one of the Pacers, Indiana took the ball with 26 seconds remaining in regulation. Granger missed an off-balance, 19-footer that left the score tied at 89. Murphy had a double-double by the half, scoring 20 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. The Heat adjusted defensively, limiting him to nine points the rest of the way on 4-of-5 shooting. Murphy had just four rebounds in the second half. "They are one of the hardest teams to guard," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "But in the second half, we grinded it out and got key stops." Wade and his teammates were able to match every run the Pacers made. With his team trailing 58-54, Wade scored 14 of the Heat's last 16 points of the third quarter, and they regained the lead at 70-67. Wade came up big again late in the fourth quarter, driving the baseline, dishing off to  Udonis Haslem  for a layup and hitting a free throw to put the Heat up 89-87 with 2:08 left in regulation. Spoelstra credited Wade for making the difference, saying, "We never got a great offensive flow, and he sensed that. He has a gift to attack and score."
