LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The  San Antonio Spurs  put a bad game behind
them in a hurry. They built a 16-point lead in the first 7:41 and remained
comfortably in front Monday night on their way to a 103-81 rout of
the  Los Angeles Clippers . "Since I've been with the Spurs, we've never had two bad games
in a row, so I know we were going to show a lot of pride tonight
and play very hard," said  Tony Parker , who orchestrated the rout
with 21 points. "We came out very strong, had a great start and we played like
that basically the whole game." The Spurs, who had lost by seven to the Lakers in the same arena
a night earlier, stormed out to a 23-7 lead on  Brent Barry 's free
throw with 4:19 remaining in the first quarter. They led 32-17 at
the end of the period. Manu Ginobili  added 18 points as the Spurs routed the Clippers
for the second time in four days. They beat them 111-82 on Friday
night in San Antonio. In the rematch,  Tim Duncan  had 17 points, six assists and five
rebounds for the Spurs, and Barry scored some of his game-high 24
points in garbage time. Elton Brand  led the lethargic Clippers with 14 points and 10
rebounds.  Paul Davis  had 15 points and  Shaun Livingston  had 11
points and eight assists. Brand said the Spurs are difficult to defend against. "They move the ball well, they move without the ball well. They
have a post threat in Duncan who's a great player, and then they
have outside shooters that can knock them down. It's hard," Brand
said. The Spurs dominated inside, with Clippers' center  Chris Kaman 
out with a stomach virus. Los Angeles started 6-foot-9 forward
 Aaron Williams  in his spot, and Parker was able to drive often, and
Duncan was able to shoot without much contention. The Clippers also were without forward  Corey Maggette , sidelined
by a bruised left knee and tendinitis in his left Achilles. "They're still a dangerous team because they've got Elton Brand
and all the other guys," Parker said. "But basically, we didn't
care who was going to play. We just wanted to bounce back from our
loss against the Lakers." Williams played just 17 minutes and had two points and three
rebounds. Rookie center Paul Davis came on and had 15 points and
six rebounds in 23 minutes. The Clippers'  Sam Cassell  left in the second quarter with an
injury to his left foot and did not return. San Antonio had a 78-63 lead heading into the fourth quarter,
and both coaches used their reserves most of the period. Ginobili had 14 points in the first half for San Antonio, which
led by as many as 23 points midway through the second quarter and
was up 59-42 at halftime. Barry added 13 points. Brand scored 12 for the Clippers in the first half. < 
^NOTES:@ Spurs coach Gregg Popovich wasn't overly excited about the
NBA's decision to go back to the old leather ball next month. "I
don't care. Everybody plays with the same ball. It's senseless. If
they made it a golf ball, we'd play with a golf ball," Popovich
said. ... Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said the "new" old ball
simply doesn't bounce straight. "You have to play like you're
playing at the old Boston Garden, looking for those dead bounces,"
Dunleavy said.
