SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seldom used in the first 12 games of the season,  Sacramento Kings  guard  Sergio Rodriguez  is currently making a huge statement for more playing time. A flashy playmaker who played the previous three years in Portland, Rodriguez was a difference-maker off the bench Sunday night for the Kings. Rodriguez scored a career-high 24 points and  Jason Thompson  had 22 points and 14 rebounds as the Kings won their third straight game with a 112-96 victory over the  New Orleans Hornets . The Kings' third option at point guard behind rookie  Tyreke Evans  and  Beno Udrih , Rodriguez is averaging 15.2 points in the past four games. His performance against the Hornets matched his point total through the first 12 games this season. "There are only so many point guard minutes we have, but the way Sergio has played lately he's kicked the door down," Kings coach Paul Westphal said. "It's going to be harder and harder not to play him." Rodriguez made two 3-pointers and converted 9 of 14 shots overall. He also had five assists, two rebounds, two steals and zero turnovers in 24 minutes. "I feel very comfortable playing here, I don't worry about going out and making things happen, I just play my game," Rodriguez said. "For me, the important thing is when I get in he [Westphal] just lets me play." The Kings took the lead for good early in the second quarter and led the remainder of the game in upping their home record to 7-2. The Kings can complete a perfect four-game homestand with a victory Wednesday over Indiana. Thompson helped the Kings establish an inside game early and it helped open up the perimeter. Sacramento shot 54 percent and converted 9 of 18 3-point attempts. "You have to give them a lot of credit,"  James Posey  said. "They were able to execute with the high screen-and-roll and we didn't stop them. They were able to keep making plays out of it." Evans had 14 points and  Andres Nocioni  and Udrih each added 13 for the Kings, who moved to .500 with a surprising 8-8 record. "It's exciting the way we are playing right now," Thompson said. "Everyone is tuned in. We have a lot of guys coming off the bench now and contributing. Hopefully we can keep things going." David West  scored 24 points for the Hornets, who had won four of their previous five.  Emeka Okafor  had 20 points and nine rebounds, and  Darren Collison  had 11 points and six assists. After making a 3-pointer to put Sacramento ahead 102-87 with 3:06 remaining, Rodriguez joyously leaped on the back of teammate John Brockman heading into a timeout. "I haven't had a 20-point game since I was a rookie, so that [3-pointer] was a great moment for me," Rodriguez said. Former King  Peja Stojakovic  missed the game for personal reasons but may rejoin the Hornets in time for Tuesday's away game against the  Los Angeles Lakers . The Kings played without starting center  Spencer Hawes , who bruised his right knee in Friday's win over New Jersey. Trailing by 12 points at the half, Okafor helped get the Hornets closer in the third quarter. He made all six shots and scored 13 points as the Hornets closed to 82-74 heading into the fourth. "There were stretches where some of our turnovers were hard to understand," Hornets coach Jeff Bower said. "A couple of those we would really like to have back." Thompson had 16 points and eight rebounds for the Kings, who pulled away with a 31-19 second quarter to assume a 57-45 halftime lead.
