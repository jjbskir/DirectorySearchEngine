SAN ANTONIO -- When the last chance for the San Antonio
Spurs came up short,  Joakim Noah  grabbed the rebound and punctuated
a third straight win with a triumphant roar.
      
 Meet the new  Chicago Bulls : unlikely road warriors. 
 
 
 
 Friedell: Road Warriors 
 
Nothing seems to be slowing Chicago right now as the banged-up Bulls grinded out their third straight road win Monday, writes Nick Friedell.  Blog 

 
 
 


 
      
 Derrick Rose  overcame feeling ill to score 27 points, including
11 in the fourth quarter, and the Bulls impressively beat another
winning Western Conference team during their seven-game road swing
with a 98-93 victory over the Spurs on Monday night.
      
 Last week it was at Phoenix, then in Houston. Put it another
way: the Bulls, now 7-15 on the road, have won just one fewer road
game in the last four days that they did in their first three
months of the season. "We're not as healthy as we'd like to be, but we're finding a
way," Bulls coach  Vinny Del Negro  said.
      
 Chicago now finishes up its Western Conference road trip against
Oklahoma City on Wednesday and New Orleans on Friday. Both teams
also have winning records, but the surging Bulls aren't playing
afraid of anyone lately.
      
 Chicago has won 11 of 16 after starting the season 10-17. With a
win against the Thunder, the Bulls (21-22) can climb back to .500.
      
 The Spurs, meanwhile, are spiraling.
      
 San Antonio lost its third straight at home, already squandering
half of its six-game homestand before hitting the road for
virtually the entire month of February. The Spurs have
traditionally used their annual "Rodeo Road Trip" to work out the
kinks -- and at this rate, there is plenty to fix.
      
 Tony Parker  scored 20 points for the Spurs, who have lost five
of six.
      
 "We have a team that can win games, especially like the one
tonight, but we just need to find way to get it done," Spurs
forward  Tim Duncan  said. "Defensively we aren't as good as we want
to be."
       Chicago entered the game as the fourth-worst shooting team in
the NBA. The Bulls began their road trip by losing at Golden State
and the  Los Angeles Clippers , but just like Chicago did wins over
the Suns and Rockets, it shot better than 50 percent from the
field.
      
 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has admonished his defense of late,
and this won't help. The Bulls hit 18 of their first 23 shots and
stayed above 70 percent shooting for most of the first half.
      
 Kirk Hinrich  added 18 points for the Bulls, and Noah had 11
after missing Saturday's win over the Rockets with plantar
fascitis.
      
 "Hopefully it means we're growing a little bit," Del Negro
said. "I'm pleased with our defense; we got some stops and put 'em
down."
      
 Duncan scored 15 points and  Antonio McDyess  had 14 for the
Spurs.  Manu Ginobili  also scored 14 but was denied twice while
barreling to the rim in the final 33 seconds.
      
 Luol Deng  made sure of that on Ginobili's first try.
      
 Deng swatted his layup back the way Ginobili came with Spurs
trailing 95-93 and 32.8 seconds left. Then down by three with 5.9
seconds left, the Spurs called Ginobili's number again but his
layup fell short.
      
 "Manu's last two plays," Spurs guard  Roger Mason Jr.  said,
"we'll take any day of the week from him."
      
 Rose didn't practice with the Bulls earlier Monday because of
flulike symptoms that Del Negro described as everything from
congestion to "not feeling good." But Rose played just fine hours
later -- even if he didn't look like it.
      
 Rose shot 13 of 23 from the floor and hit a pull-up jumper with
56.9 seconds left to put the Bulls ahead 93-91. But Rose clearly
wasn't feeling well.
      
 Del Negro said at one point, Rose asked him to "give me a
couple more minutes." Rose wasn't pale, Del Negro said, but he had
his hands on his knees.
      
 Rose left without speaking to reporters.
      
 In his absence, Noah stated the obvious.
      
 "I'm not gonna lie: D-Rose is playing at a really high level,"
he said.
      
 Game notes  Newly acquired Bulls G  Devin Brown  was expected to join
the team in Oklahoma City on Tuesday. The Bulls obtained Brown in a
trade with New Orleans before the game, giving up C  Aaron Gray .
...The Spurs are on their third three-game slide of the season.
