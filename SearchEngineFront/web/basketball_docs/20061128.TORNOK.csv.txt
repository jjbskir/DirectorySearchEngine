OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The  Toronto Raptors  found a way to win away
from home: Don't give up so many points. Chris Bosh  had 19 points and 14 rebounds, and the Raptors had
their best defensive effort of the season in a 94-77 victory over
the New Orleans Hornets. It was their first win on the road in
eight tries. "We're really starting to clog that lane up," Bosh said.
"That's what you have to do on the road, play defense well." The Raptors had been allowing an average of 106 points in their
seven road losses, and they hadn't given up fewer than 97 in any of
their games outside of Canada. With the Hornets missing two of
their top three scorers, Toronto was able to hold New Orleans to 32
second-half points. "This is a big win for us on the road," Toronto coach Sam
Mitchell said. "Any time you can go on the road in this league and
get a win is big." Anthony Parker  also had 19 points, and the Raptors got a big
lift with 45 points from their bench. No. 1 overall pick Andrea
Bargnani scored a career-high 16,  Joey Graham  added 14 and Jose
Calderon tied his season best with 13 points for Toronto -- all
three off the bench. "This team's got really good chemistry. There's no drop-off
from the first guys that come out to the second guys that come
in," said Graham, a first-round pick last year out of Oklahoma
State. "We don't look at it as first- and second-team. We just
look at it as playing together and we all put in effort and hard
work." Chris Paul  had 16 points and 11 assists to lead New Orleans.
 Rasual Butler , starting for the injured  Peja Stojakovic , added 12
points and  Tyson Chandler  pulled down 17 rebounds. Also without
 David West  (forearm), last season's leading scorer, the Hornets
haven't scored more than 83 points during a four-game losing
streak. "I think the fact that, again, another team has come in and
outplayed and outworked us is more disappointing than the loss,"
Hornets coach Byron Scott said. "One thing that we did a lot of
last year was show our resiliency. We aren't showing that right
now. We are submitting and hoping that a team gives us a win. "Or, we are feeling a little sorry for ourselves because we are
missing two of our key players." The Raptors opened a 61-51 lead with a 12-4 run after Chandler
started the second half by tipping in  Desmond Mason 's miss. Paul
brought the Hornets back within four with a 3-pointer from the top
of the key, but Bosh's three-point play sparked a surge of nine
straight Toronto points for a 72-59 lead after three quarters. Toronto kept pulling away, and the lead reached 89-68 when
Bargnani hit a 3-pointer from the right wing to surpass his best
output of the season. New Orleans led by seven late in the first quarter before
allowing Toronto to score the next 11 points in a run that
overlapped the quarter break. The Raptors' lead reached 42-35
before the Hornets closed within four points at halftime. The Hornets continue to be streaky, although the pattern has now
changed. New Orleans won its first four games before losing the
next three, then did the same thing over the next seven games. But
now the losing streak isn't stopping. Game notes Stojakovic, who missed his second straight game with back
spasms, had an MRI before the game. "It's just a matter of us
getting some more information ... to find out where he is and find
out if we can be a little bit more aggressive in what we're doing,
as long as there's no serious damage back there," Scott said. ...
Hornets G  Bobby Jackson , who was fined $20,000 after being ejected
Saturday at Dallas, was not suspended. "When you have Peja and
David (West) already out, you can't afford to miss another piece of
the puzzle," Scott said. ... Grammy winner LeAnn Rimes sang the
