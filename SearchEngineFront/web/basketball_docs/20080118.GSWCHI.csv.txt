CHICAGO (AP) --  Baron Davis  was happy with the win and pleased to match his career high with 40 points. But the arena and its history made it even more special. "I did it in the United Center. That was sweet," Davis said Friday night after leading Golden State past the  Chicago Bulls , 119-111. "I scored 40 in the United Center," he added. "I felt like [Michael] Jordan out there." It's been a long time since Jordan made 40-point games a norm. And the team he once played for, the Bulls, aren't close to what they once were. "The season's not going well and everything looks bad right now," said Chicago's  Andres Nocioni . The Bulls just couldn't contain the quick-scoring Warriors, especially in the second half. With Davis making six 3-pointers -- he was 5-for-5 in the third quarter -- and  Stephen Jackson  scoring 12 of his 24 in the fourth quarter, the Warriors got the hard-earned road win with a strong finish. Ben Gordon  led Chicago with 29 points and Nocioni added 28. "The first half our zone bothered them a little bit and we were able to slow them down," Gordon said. "In the second half, B.D. [Davis] made a lot of tough shots. He's an All-Star caliber player." Matt Barnes  scored the go-ahead basket for Golden State, grabbing a loose ball as Nocioni tried to save it, putting the Warriors up 106-104 with just over two minutes to go. Joe Smith 's basket cut it to one before Jackson dropped in two free throws with 1:20 left, making it 109-106. After Gordon's two free throws again made it a one-point game, Jackson took a pass from Davis and made a 3-pointer from the deep corner, putting the Warriors up four with 46 seconds left. "Baron had a monster game and I just played off of him. He got me open shots and I was able to knock that one down in the fourth quarter when it counted," Jackson said. Even after going just 7-for-27 in the second quarter, the Warriors felt their shots would start to fall and they did -- just in time. They trailed by 12 in the third quarter before it began to click. "We weren't making shots at all. But I felt like I was in a good groove coming out in the third," Davis said. "I hit my first two shots and I just wanted to be as aggressive as possible. It opened it up for us." Golden State outscored the Bulls 35-27 in the fourth quarter. Davis was 5-for-5 on 3-pointers in the third quarter, scoring 19 points in the period as the Warriors erased a 12-point deficit. With Chicago ahead 69-57, Davis went to work, making a nice feed to  Monta Ellis  for a basket and then hitting two 3-pointers. Jackson hit another one and suddenly the Warriors were within three. Davis connected on his fourth 3-pointer of the quarter, giving the Warriors a brief 79-78 lead. His fifth tied it at 84 headed into the final period. Nocioni scored 18 points while playing only 12:48 in the first half. He had a three-point play and a 3-pointer during a 16-3 Chicago run starting the second quarter. The Warriors started the period by missing their first 14 field goal attempts as the Bulls raced to a 45-31 lead. Davis converted a three-point play after a goaltending call, then sank a 3-pointer as the Warriors cut the lead in half, making it 51-44 with about three minutes to go in the half. Golden State shot 11-for-18 in the opening quarter but hit only 7-of-27 in the second and trailed 58-50 because the Bulls hit 63 percent in the first half. Game notes  Chicago starting point guard  Kirk Hinrich  missed his third straight game with a sore back and got a second opinion. Coach Jim Boylan said it was muscular in nature and the Bulls hoped to have Hinrich back shortly. ... Warriors backup F  Austin Croshere  sat out with a sore back. ... The Bulls are 1-1 since a reported verbal exchange between  Joakim Noah  and  Ben Wallace  following a lopsided loss in Orlando on Tuesday night.
