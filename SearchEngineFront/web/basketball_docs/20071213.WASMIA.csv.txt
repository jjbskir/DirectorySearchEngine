MIAMI (AP) -- The scene repeated itself often. 
 DeShawn Stevenson  would make a jumper, then wave his right hand over his face.       It's his customary celebration.       It's also become customary to see teams do that sort of thing when visiting the  Miami Heat .       Stevenson scored a season-high 26 points,  Caron Butler  finished with 19 points and nine rebounds and all five Washington starters reached double figures in the Wizards' 104-91 victory Thursday night.       Miami dropped to 2-7 at home this season.       "I'm beyond disappointed in our team," Heat coach Pat Riley said.        Antawn Jamison  had 16 points and 16 rebounds,  Brendan Haywood  added 12 points and  Antonio Daniels  scored 11 for Washington, which was winless in its last eight at Miami and had dropped 15 of 16 overall to the Heat.       The Wizards improved to 12-4 when scoring at least 100 points; they're 0-6 when not reaching the century mark.      "A lot of people are doubting us and underestimating our ability to go out there and perform at a high level but we continue to prove doubters wrong," Butler said. "We're going to go out there and leave it all on the court and just get better on the fly."        Chris Quinn  scored a career-high 22 points for Miami, which saw its modest two-game winning streak end and lost for the seventh time in nine home games this season. Only Minnesota (2-8) has a worse home record.       "I can't explain it," said Miami forward  Udonis Haslem , who finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds.        Dwyane Wade  added 17 points, and  Ricky Davis  had 16 for Miami (6-16).  Shaquille O'Neal  finished with only seven points on 3-for-6 shooting in 26 minutes.       "There's no excuses," Riley said. "There are none. I have none. The players should have none. ... Tonight, we didn't hardly even try."       Miami got within seven three times -- on scores by Haslem every time -- in the first 5½ minutes of the final quarter, only to see Washington answer before the margin got any smaller.       And eventually, the Wizards put Miami away.       Stevenson, who entered with 28 points on 32 percent shooting in his last four games, delivered the dagger with 4:41 left -- a long 3-pointer, his sixth of the night, that made it 96-84.       "I get so pumped up when everyone is playing well and making shots," Stevenson said. "It's a great feeling. We've just got to have that chip on our shoulder."       Washington led for all but 38 seconds of the opening half, taking a 59-49 lead into the break after Stevenson hit five of his first six shots, including a 4-for-5 early show from 3-point range, for 18 points.       Stevenson scored 10 consecutive points during a 73-second span of the first quarter, staking the Wizards to a 24-11 lead, and Washington's cushion was 15 when O'Neal went to the bench with his third foul at the 4:59 mark.       So Riley went small - very small - with a lineup of Quinn, Wade,  Daequan Cook , Davis and Haslem.       It worked. An 11-3 run immediately drew Miami within seven, and the Heat later closed the gap to 59-54 after scoring the first five points of the second half.       Butler took over for the next few minutes, giving Miami fans another taste of what they used to cheer him for before he left in the trade that brought O'Neal to South Florida.       He scored 10 points in a 16-2 Washington run that rebuilt the lead back to 75-56 with 4:12 left in the third, and the margin was 82-70 entering the fourth.       "We let a couple slip away here the last couple years but we stayed with it, we stayed confident, our defense was excellent when it needed to be," Jamison said. "When they made some runs we stayed poised. That's the sign of a team going in the right direction."       And in Miami's case, the opposite seems to be ringing true.       "This is definitely a step back," Quinn said. Game notes  Washington has had five players in double figures in each of the last four games. Last time that happened? March 2004. ... Haslem's streak of 89 minutes, 55 seconds -- nearly two full games -- without a rest ended with 9:56 left in the second quarter. He played the final 27:53 at the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Sunday and all 48 minutes in Phoenix the next night. ... Stevenson's previous best this season was 22 points against Philadelphia on Nov. 20. ... Newly signed  Luke Jackson  made his Miami debut with 2:58 left in the third. He finished with six points.
