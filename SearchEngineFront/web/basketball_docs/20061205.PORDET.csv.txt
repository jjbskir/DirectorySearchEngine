AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit basketball fans have fond
memories of  Zach Randolph 's days at Michigan State. They aren't enjoying his pro career quite as much. Randolph had 31 points and 13 rebounds Tuesday night, including
a go-ahead basket with 21.6 seconds to go, and the Portland Trail
Blazers snapped a five-game losing streak with an 88-85 win over
Detroit. "This is a big win," he said. "You can't do better than this
-- starting a road trip by beating one of the best teams in the
league." Randolph had a career-high 37 points in his last trip to the
Palace, a 93-89 loss on Dec. 20, 2005. "I love playing in Detroit," he said. "I went to college
around here, and I love coming back." Richard Hamilton  had 25 for Detroit, which lost its second
straight after an eight-game winning streak. "This was a horrible loss for us," said  Chauncey Billups , who
kept the Pistons close with eight points in the final 4 minutes.
"These are the kind of games that can haunt you late in the
season." Detroit also lost Sunday in Charlotte. The Trail Blazers and
Bobcats are a combined 12-24. "We haven't had a sense of urgency in the last two games,"
Pistons coach Flip Saunders said. "When you win eight in a row,
you start maybe feeling too good about yourself." Juan Dixon 's jumper broke an 80-all tie with 2:13 left, and
after Billups made a technical-foul free throw,  Jarrett Jack  hit
two shots from the line to give the Trail Blazers an 84-81 lead. Rasheed Wallace 's layup made it a one-point game, and Dixon
missed a long jumper before Billups gave the Pistons the lead with
a 22-footer. Randolph answered with a driving jumper over Tayshaun
Prince, putting Portland ahead 86-85. Hamilton missed twice at the other end and Jack increased the
margin to three with a pair of free throws with 2 seconds to play.
Hamilton shot an airball at the buzzer. "I'm happy," Portland coach Nate McMillan said. "We just beat
an unbelievable team on the road after some disappointing losses at
home." Jack finished with 18 points and rookie  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 11
points and 11 rebounds. "Jarrett went up against possibly the best point guard in the
league in Chauncey, and did a pretty good job," McMillan said.
"LaMarcus had 11 and 11 against two of the best guys in the league
in Rasheed and  Tayshaun Prince . This just shows that we're a young
team. Some nights we'll look really good and some nights we'll look
like a young, inexperienced team." Billups finished with 17 for Detroit. "Hopefully, we can turn this around real quick," Billups said. Detroit led 44-41 at halftime, helped by 15 first-quarter points
from Hamilton. Portland outrebounded the Pistons 23-16 in the first
half, but only forced two turnovers. The Trail Blazers scored the first eight points of the third
quarter, including a 3-pointer by  Ime Udoka , and held a slim lead
for most of the period. Billups, though, hit a late 3 to let the Pistons enter the
fourth tied at 64. Dan Dickau , who hadn't played in the first three quarters, hit
an early 3-pointer to give Portland a 69-66 lead, and the Pistons
struggled to regain the lead. Another Billups 3-pointer pulled them to 79-78 with 3:39 to
play, and he tied it at 80 with a pair of free throws a minute
later. Game notes Prince picked up a third-quarter technical for arguing a
call, and Portland was called for a defensive three-second
violation with 1:52 to play. ... Tigers outfielder Craig Monroe
watched the game from a seat behind the Portland bench. ...
Portland rookie  Brandon Roy  missed the game with a sore left heel,
and Detroit's  Lindsey Hunter  was out with a sore right Achilles'
tendon. ... Randolph had to ice his sore right knee during the
first half, but was able to return to the game. "I thought I was
done, but I was able to run it out," he said.
