NEW YORK (AP) -- In their best half of basketball this season,
there was really only one thing the  Charlotte Bobcats  did wrong.

 Okafor Emeka Okafor had 20 points and 10 blocks in the Bobcats' win at Madison Square Garden. Over the last 11 seasons, only three other players reached those levels in both categories in an NBA game: Shawn Bradley for Dallas in April 1998 (22 points, 13 blocks), Dikembe Mutombo for Atlanta in February 2000 (21, 11) and Amare Stoudemire for Phoenix in February 2004 (20, 10).

 Matt Carroll  couldn't get out of the way. Emeka Okafor  had 20 points and a career-high 10 blocked shots,
 Derek Anderson  scored 29 points, and the Bobcats snapped the New
York Knicks' three-game winning streak with a 126-110 victory
Friday night. Carroll added 23 points, but also grabbed the rebound on the
final missed shot of the game. The Bobcats desperately wanted
Okafor to get it so he could have the first triple-double of his
career. "I had no idea," Carroll said. "I feel bad now. If I would
have known, I definitely would have let him have that one. He's
more of a rebounder than me anyway, so I don't get in trouble if I
don't rebound that much." There was nothing else to complain about for Charlotte, which
shot 66 percent during a season-best 74-point second half. The
Bobcats finished at 59.3 percent for the game, easily their best
effort of the season. Charlotte scored 36 points in the third quarter and 38 in the
fourth, both season highs for those periods. "I think the way we executed our offense in the second half and
hit shots in the second half was probably the best we played
probably this year," Carroll said. Carroll continued his recent strong play, increasing his average
to 21.7 points over the last six games.  Raymond Felton  added 16
points and 14 assists, and Okafor took care of the rest with the
highest blocked shot total in the NBA this season that matched the
highest at the current Madison Square Garden. "You can't block shots if they don't challenge you, and they
kept challenging me," Okafor said. "And I kept having success
with it." Stephon Marbury  scored 28 points and  Eddy Curry  added 27 for the
Knicks, who were seeking their sixth straight home victory and
second over Charlotte this season. They beat the Bobcats 111-109 on
Dec. 20 when  David Lee  tipped in a long pass from  Jamal Crawford 
just before the buzzer to end the second overtime. "We ran into a hot team," Knicks coach Isiah Thomas said.
"They shot well, they made shots. They did the correct things,
they made plays. I don't have any excuses other than the other team
that we played tonight, they were hot. They did everything right." The Bobcats were ahead by one at halftime, but outscored the
Knicks 20-9 in the first 5 minutes of the third quarter to build a
12-point lead. Leading by three, the Bobcats got two 3-pointers
from Carroll and another from Anderson in an 11-2 spurt that gave
them a 72-60 advantage with 7:08 left in the third quarter.
Charlotte hit nine of its first 11 shots in the period. Charlotte shot 67 percent (12-of-18) in the period, when it
outscored New York 36-27. Carroll had 10 points in the period. Anderson finished 9-of-11 in his best game of the season and
Carroll was 8-of-12. The Bobcats went 10-of-18 (56 percent) beyond
the 3-point line. "Matt Carroll, Derek Anderson, Felton, they played a tremendous
game at the guard spots," Lee said. "They were hitting shots
tonight. They definitely were shooting above their percentages.
That's the same team that just went in and beat Detroit. They're a
hot team right now." The Knicks climbed within seven in the fourth quarter before
Marbury's no-look pass hit Curry on top of his head and led to a
fast break, which  Primoz Brezec  capped with a jumper for a 101-92
lead with 6:35 left. Felton scored on a drive on the next
possession to push the lead back into double digits, and the
Bobcats were safely ahead the rest of the way. Channing Frye  scored 10 points in the first quarter as the
Knicks built a 30-26 lead despite allowing Charlotte to shoot 57
percent. New York extended the lead to nine with under 3 minutes
remaining in the half, but the Bobcats scored the final 10 points,
taking a 52-51 advantage into the locker room after Felton
converted a three-point play with 18 seconds to go. Game notes Lee (61.2) and Curry (57.5) entered second and fifth in the
NBA in field goal percentage. ... Carroll came in as the league's
top foul shooter at 93.8 percent (61-of-65). He went 4-of-5 Friday.
... Bobcats swingman  Gerald Wallace  missed his fourth straight game
with an injured right shoulder. ... The Knicks' record for blocks
by an opponent is held by Larry Nance, who had 11 for Cleveland on
Jan. 7, 1989.
