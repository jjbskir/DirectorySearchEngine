 Randolph, who was booed at times by the Portland crowd, also had 11 rebounds. While the Rose Garden fans' reaction suggested that many associate Randolph with the so-called "Jail Blazers" era, Randolph clearly has a soft spot for Portland. "I miss the rain," he said. "I miss everything. I came here at 19 and I still have a house here." But the brief trip down memory lane was also a motivational factor. "I played here, so it definitely is motivating to try and get the win," he said. "Plus, we needed the win anyway." The Clippers (5-17), with the second-worst record in the Western Conference, sure did.  Baron Davis  contributed 27 points and made a 3-pointer that sent the game into overtime. Brandon Roy  scored a career-high 38 points, but the Blazers (15-10) dropped their third straight game. Rookie  Greg Oden  had 15 points and 15 rebounds. After Roy's jumper tied it at 108 in the second overtime, the Clippers made four unanswered baskets to go up 116-108 and cruise to the victory. Randolph was drafted by the Blazers in 2001 and played six seasons in Portland before he was traded to New York. He was acquired by the Clippers in a Nov. 21 trade with the Knicks, a deal that also brought guard  Mardy Collins  west. The Clippers sent forward  Tim Thomas  and guard  Cuttino Mobley  to New York. Mobley on Thursday announced his retirement from the NBA because of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a genetic heart disease. Tests done after the trade indicated the condition had worsened. After sending the game into overtime with his 3-pointer, Davis opened the extra period with another one. Roy's second consecutive fadeaway jumper tied it at 106 with 15 seconds left in the first overtime, and Davis missed on a long jumper at the buzzer for a second OT. The Clippers went on an 8-0 run to open the second quarter and went up 50-44 lead on Davis' layup before taking a 57-54 lead into the break. The Blazers went back ahead at 70-69 on Oden's dunk. But the Clippers kept it close and the teams traded the lead back and forth through most of the second half. Randolph was blocked and then fouled by Oden with 3:13 left, and Randolph postured by bumping the 7-rookie with his shoulder. On the other end, Randolph was called for fouling Oden, despite his repeated appeals to the referees that Oden had traveled. Oden's second free throw tied it at 92 with 2:50 left. "Oden is tough," Randolph said. "He's solid." Roy hit a pair of free throws to give the Blazers the lead, and both teams went scoreless until his jumper with 28 seconds left. Roy's short jumper bounced around the rim before falling to make it 96-92. But  Al Thornton  narrowed it for the Clippers with a long jumper. Steve Blake  went on to miss four of five free throw attempts for the Blazers before Davis' 3-pointer. Blake went into the game having made 31 of 33 free throws over the Blazers' first 24 games. "Yeah, I'm taking it personally, of course," Blake said. "The game was on my shoulders and I let them down." The Blazers were without reserve forward  Travis Outlaw , who bruised his tailbone when he took a hard fall in a loss to the  Utah Jazz  the night before. Game notes The Blazers swept the Clippers in three games last season. ...  Darius Miles , a former Blazer and Clipper, worked out for the Clippers this week. Miles had microfracture surgery on his right knee in November 2006 while with Portland and hasn't played since. The Blazers waived him at the end of last season. The Clippers drafted Miles with the third overall pick in the 2000 draft.
