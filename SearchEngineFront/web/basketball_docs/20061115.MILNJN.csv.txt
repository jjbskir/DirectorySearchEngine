EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- With  Richard Jefferson  out with a
sprained ankle and  Vince Carter  battling a flu bug,  Jason Kidd  put on a one-man show for the  New Jersey Nets . Kidd scored a season-high 25 points and added 11 assists and eight rebounds to lead the Nets to a 100-87 victory over the  Milwaukee Bucks  on Wednesday night. "I didn't know if Vince was going or not so my mind-set was to
come out and grab control of the game," Kidd said. "My plan
didn't change when I found out Vince was going. I wanted to help
him out on the offensive end because we've relied on him so much to
carry us. I made some early shots and my teammates found me." Kidd hit his first four shots and six of his first seven to
become the first Nets player other than Carter to lead the team in
scoring this season. The 33-year old scored 11 straight points in a
21-3 first-quarter spurt that gave New Jersey the lead for good. "Jason understands the game. He understands with R.J. out, he
has to step it up," Carter said. "From the jump ball it was his
show. He was man possessed tonight. It was great to see." Carter, who battled flu symptoms all day and was a
game-time decision to start, finished with 15 points, none in the
fourth quarter.  Nenad Krstic  added 22 points. "Just having Vince on the floor was a huge plus," Nets coach
Lawrence Frank said. "He could have very easily sat out. He
obviously wasn't 100 percent but he put the uniform on and gave us
what he had." Mo Williams  had a season-high 26 points for Milwaukee, which was
playing on consecutive nights.  Michael Redd  added 25 points for the
Bucks, who were without leading rebounder  Charlie Villanueva . He
hurt an elbow Tuesday night and was sent home for further
evaluation. "It was good to see Mo make some shots," Bucks coach Terry
Stotts said. "We had some good looks at the end of the fourth
quarter to make it interesting. It's a game that you are
disappointed that you don't come away with a win." The game was billed as a showdown of the NBA's top two scorers,
Redd (32.1) and Carter (31.2). It was Kidd who stole the show in nearly picking up his 78th
career triple-double, which would have tied him third in NBA
history with Wilt Chamberlain. "He's awesome, there is nothing you can do about it," said
Bucks forward  Ruben Patterson , who added 15 points. "He was
hitting every shot he shot up. You really can't say anything, a guy
on like that, there's nothing you can do." Kidd sparked the Nets' first-quarter run, during which New
Jersey scored points on 10 straight possessions. He hit two layups,
two free throws, a 3-pointer and jumper in building a 24-11 lead. New Jersey increased the margin to 41-27 with a 10-2 run to open
the second quarter. At the center of the scoring again was Kidd,
who hit another 3-pointer and picked up another bucket on a drive. Milwaukee never completely went away, and pulled to within six
on two occasions in the third quarter -- the last time at 66-60 on a
three-point play by Williams. But  Antoine Wright  converted a
three-point play and Milwaukee never got closer than eight points
the rest of the way.
