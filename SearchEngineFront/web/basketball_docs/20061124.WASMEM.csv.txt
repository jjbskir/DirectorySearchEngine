 Arenas Gilbert Arenas, who had scored 20 or more points in each of his previous 10 games, was held to three points in 32 minutes. Only one other player in NBA history had a single-season streak of at least 10 games scoring at least 20 points broken by scoring three or fewer points in at least 30 minutes. On March 11, 1981, Bernard King scored two points in 35 minutes for Golden State, after he scored at least 20 points in each of his previous 12 games.

 "We defended for four quarters consistently ... but you also have to take into account that you caught him on a night when things would not fall for him," Fratello said after Memphis' 95-80 victory Friday night. It was Washington's seventh straight loss on the road. Hakim Warrick  led Memphis with 18 points on 5-of-8 shooting, while  Caron Butler  had 22 points and 13 rebounds for the Wizards. But Arenas, who came in ranked fourth in the NBA in scoring, was little help for Washington, going 1-for-12 from the field. He had a dunk with 6 minutes left and hit one of two free throws with 2:35 to go. "I was just missing shots," Arenas said. "It was just one of those nights. They come and they go." The Wizards return to Washington for three games, and Arenas said he'll be happy to be home. "We can catch some momentum before we go on the road again," Arenas said. "It will be a good test for us. We're getting tested right now." The Grizzlies are also winless on the road. Memphis got 15 points from  Chucky Atkins , 11 points and 10 rebounds from  Stromile Swift  and 14 points each from  Dahntay Jones  and  Mike Miller . Jones helped Memphis to a 31-18 scoring advantage among the reserves. "We try to spark up the bench and add something to the game," Jones said. "And we got a chance to do that tonight." DeShawn Stevenson  had 14 points for the Wizards, while  Antawn Jamison  added 13 and  Etan Thomas  had 10 points and 11 rebounds. The Grizzlies' Atkins was modest about his part in guarding Arenas. "It's hard to defend a player like him. He just missed shots," Atkins said. "I don't really think it was anything we did." Washington trailed 58-55 with 3:07 left in the third period after a layup by Jamison, but the Grizzlies put together a 10-2 run and entered the final period up 68-59. Jamison opened the fourth quarter with five straight points and brought the Wizards to 68-64, but they could get no closer. The Grizzlies led by 12 points in the second quarter before settling for a 41-37 halftime advantage.
