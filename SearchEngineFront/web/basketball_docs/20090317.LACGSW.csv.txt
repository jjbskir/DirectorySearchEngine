OAKLAND, Calif. --  Monta Ellis  showed why he's the future Warriors point guard. He played a lot like last year's point guard,  Baron Davis . Ellis matched his season high with 29 points,  Corey Maggette  had 21, and Golden State defeated the  Los Angeles Clippers  127-120 Tuesday night, its seventh straight home win against the Clippers. "He took another nice step," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "There's nothing wrong with being a scoring point guard. He tried to make plays, ran what coach wanted and showed good vision." Davis also scored 29 points in his first game in Oakland since opting out of his contract with the Warriors. He received a warm ovation before the game and even handed out a few hugs courtside just before tip-off. "It was all about the fans tonight. I was just letting them know how much I appreciated them," Davis said. "It was fun playing back in Oracle. It's different being on another team and playing here, but at the same time we wanted to get this victory. It would have been sweet if we got it." Anthony Morrow  added 20 points as the Warriors won their third in four games.  Kelenna Azubuike  had 16 and  Anthony Randolph  14. "Coach called the plays and I tried to give the ball to the open man on a mismatch," Ellis said. "We were the better team tonight and we came out with a win." Morrow credited Ellis in keeping the team together without  Stephen Jackson  and  Andris Biedrins . "It was a huge effort by everybody," Morrow said. "But Monta was the leader. He stepped up and showed he's a special player." Al Thornton  had 25 points and nine rebounds, but the Clippers lost their sixth straight on the road.  Zach Randolph  had 20 points and 11 rebounds and  Marcus Camby  had 14 points and 11 rebounds. The Clippers pulled within four points of the Warriors three times in the fourth quarter but could never close the gap, falling to 1-22 when trailing after three quarters on the road. "A big game from Monta Ellis and I thought their bench killed us," Clippers coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "They shot the ball really well; that's what they do. We didn't make them play defense on enough possessions." Jackson sat out the game after his one-game suspension was handed down from the NBA for receiving his 16th technical foul of the season during Sunday's 154-130 loss to Phoenix. Biedrins was out with a sprained left ankle. Marco Belinelli  started in place of  Jamal Crawford , whom Nelson benched so he could give the 6-foot-5 Italian guard extended playing time. He played just over 16 minutes. The Warriors built a 15-point advantage following a three-point play from Randolph before settling for a 92-81 lead entering the final quarter. The Warriors ended the first half with an 18-7 run to take a 59-51 lead into intermission. Game notes  Belinelli missed the last three games with turf toe. ...
