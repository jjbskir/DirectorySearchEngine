	   MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The  Memphis Grizzlies  have lost 60 games
this season, but something good may come of this one. 	    Brad Miller  had 17 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to lead
the  Sacramento Kings  to a 112-100 victory over the lowly Grizzlies
on Tuesday night, assuring Memphis of the worst record in the NBA. 	  With three games left, Memphis has 19 wins, while the  Boston Celtics , despite losing Tuesday night at Atlanta, already have 23
victories. 	   And with the Grizzlies holding that distinction, they get the
best odds of winning the draft lottery and landing the No. 1 pick
in the draft. Not that Memphis players wanted to talk about that on
the day Texas freshman and college player of the year  Kevin Durant 
announced he was going to the NBA. 	   "In three games, the season's over with, and that's how I look
at it," said Memphis guard  Chucky Atkins , who had 11 points and 10
assists. 	    Mike Bibby  scored 25 points for the Kings, who snapped a
four-game road losing streak in a game where the only thoughts
either team had regarding the postseason was their draft spot.
Memphis has lost six straight. 	   Six of the eight Kings who played finished in double figures. 	    Francisco Garcia  scored a season-high 19 points for Sacramento,
while grabbing eight rebounds.  Justin Williams  had 16 points, and
 Shareef Abdur-Rahim  finished with 14. 	    Dahntay Jones  led Memphis with 20 points, while  Pau Gasol  scored
17 and grabbed nine rebounds.  Tarence Kinsey  and  Stromile Swift 	   Both teams were without key players. The Kings'  Kevin Martin  was
ill and  Corliss Williamson  missed his fourth game in the last five
with an ailing right heel. 	   Meanwhile, the Grizzlies played without  Mike Miller  and  Damon Stoudamire  with knee injuries -- Miller in both knees and Stoudamire
in his right. Grizzlies rookie  Rudy Gay  also was out after injuring
his ankle two games ago. 	   The Kings settled 
for a 53-48 lead at the half after Memphis cut
into a big early Sacramento lead. The Kings shot 71 percent in the
early stages of the first quarter and ended the period at 63
percent. That, coupled with seven Memphis turnovers and a stretch
of almost seven minutes where the Grizzlies didn't score, helped
Sacramento score 25 straight points and build a 26-point lead. 	   The run was the second-largest of the season in the NBA. Miami
scored 27 unanswered points against the  New York Knicks  on Jan. 22. 	   "I've never been a part of something like that," Kings forward
 Ron Artest  said. "That was fun to be a part of. I didn't even
score a bucket in that, and I was having fun." 	   Garcia had 15 points before the break, while Bibby added 12, and
Abdur-Rahim scored 10 points. 	   Gasol had 12 points for Memphis, while Jones and  Hakim Warrick 
added 10 points apiece. 	   "We were a little passive on defense, and they were able to get
a lot of open looks," Gasol said of the early scoring. 	   Memphis cut into the lead before the half with a late 13-2 run.
Sacramento connecting on 5-of-18 from the field in the second
quarter. 	   "We made them miss in the second quarter by playing good
fullcourt defense," Memphis coach Tony Barone said.
"Unfortunately for us, we couldn't maintain our level of intensity
for the rest of the game. We got stuck in the mud in the first
quarter." 	   Despite an offensive flurry from Swift in the third, the Kings
maintained an 81-70 lead entering the final period. Memphis never
got it under double digits down the stretch. 	   Abdur-Rahim, who played his first five seasons with the
Grizzlies when they were in Vancouver, has seen this type of season
from the franchise. He said there is a different attitude about the
end of the season between veterans and the younger players like the
ones trying to establish their NBA credentials with Memphis limping
down the stretch. 	   "My first four years in the league, I was still young and
trying to establish myself," Abdur-Rahim said. "It's different.
For veteran guys, especially if you've been on playoff teams, it's
tougher. 	   "Older guys, you have to really push yourself and challenge
yourself to stay professional."  Game notes  The 60 losses are the most by the Grizzlies since the
1999-00 team dropped 60 while in Vancouver. ... Miller's
triple-double was the third of his career. ... The Grizzlies have
never won a season series over Sacramento. Tuesday's loss meant the
Kings won this year's series 2-1. ... Garcia started his third game
of the season in place of Martin. ... Kings coach Eric Musselman
was a Grizzlies assistant before taking the Sacramento job this
season. ... After committing seven turnovers in the first quarter,
Memphis only had four more the rest of the way. ... Williams added
11 rebounds for the first double-double of his career.
