SAN ANTONIO (AP) --  Tim Duncan  beat the stomach flu -- and the
 Atlanta Hawks . Duncan had 17 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks, and Tony
Parker scored 27 points to help the  San Antonio Spurs  beat the
Hawks 95-81 on Sunday. "(Duncan) did a great job, especially with the way he was
feeling yesterday," said  Manu Ginobili , who missed a game Tuesday
night because of the bug. "When I was first feeling bad, the following day I was feeling
terrible. So I was surprised. I didn't expect him to contribute
much." Duncan's playing status wasn't certain until about 20 minutes
before the game. At least five other Spurs have been affected by
the bug. "I thought Timmy did a great job coming off the flu he had
yesterday to come back and play like he did," Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich said. "I didn't think he would play." The Hawks have lost seven straight and 11 of 12 to drop to 9-20.
The Hawks have lost nine straight in San Antonio dating to Feb. 15,
1997. The Spurs led 67-61 after three quarters, and opened the fourth
with a 10-0 run. San Antonio outscored the Hawks 14-2 on the fast break in the
fourth quarter. "We were feeling pretty good about ourselves at the end of the
third period down by only six points," Hawks coach Mike Woodson
said. "We need a lot of help offensively. This team is fighting a
lack of chemistry." San Antonio outrebounded Atlanta 55-43, including a 14-8
advantage in offensive rebounds. The Hawks committed only three more turnovers than the Spurs,
but San Antonio scored 27 points off the Hawks' 21 mistakes
compared to the nine points Atlanta converted off turnovers. The Spurs beat Atlanta 23-6 on the fast break, which led to a
54-26 advantage San Antonio had scoring points in the paint. Joe Johnson  scored 23 points for the Hawks and  Josh Childress 
added 19. It was Parker's third straight game scoring more than 20 points
and fourth in his last five. Led by Ginobili's 8-of-10 performance from the floor, the
Duncan-Ginobili-Parker trio combined to shoot 25-of-41. The rest of
the team was 12-of-39. "It was a great all-around effort," Popovich said. Game notes Atlanta was 7-22 after 29 games in 2005-06. ... F Robert
