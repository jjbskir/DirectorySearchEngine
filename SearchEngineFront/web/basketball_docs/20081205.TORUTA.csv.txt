SALT LAKE CITY --  Paul Millsap  got his usual double-double and added a career high in assists. Millsap had 17 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, and the Jazz beat Toronto 114-87 on Friday night in interim coach Jay Triano's Raptors debut. Millsap also had three blocked shots in his seventh straight double-double, filling in nicely as All-Star  Carlos Boozer  recovers from a thigh injury. "His play has just been outstanding," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "The way he played tonight -- going after the ball relentlessly, finding rebounds, doing whatever he has to do -- it's really been fun to watch. I can't say enough about him." Mehmet Okur  led Utah with 21 points on 9-for-13 shooting. Matt Harpring  had 14 points and seven rebounds in his first game after missing five because of a back injury, and  Deron Williams  had 14 points and five assists to help the Jazz beat the Raptors for the seventh straight time. Utah had lost two straight at home -- half as many as last season's total. "I'd like to see the energy that we saw tonight," Sloan said. "Our fans booed us the last two games we lost in this building. They want to see them compete, and I think they have a right to." Chris Bosh  had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Toronto, playing its first game since coach  Sam Mitchell  was fired the day after a 132-93 loss at Denver on Wednesday night. Toronto didn't fare any better under Triano, Mitchell's former assistant who had all of one practice to try to reroute the Raptors. "We have been through a lot in the last couple of days, trying to relearn things. I think until it becomes a natural thing for us to just flow, we are going to look a little lethargic like that," said Triano, the first Canadian head coach in NBA history. "They were trying to do what we asked them to, so I applaud that." The Raptors committed 23 turnovers and were outrebounded 52-38, including just three offensive rebounds and lost their third straight. "We're going to be all right," said  Jose Calderon , who had 10 points and eight assists for Toronto. "For moments, it was OK. Everybody was feeling comfortable with the new things, but we need a little bit more time." The Jazz were without Boozer for the ninth straight game, but outscored the Raptors in all four quarters and got an obvious lift from the return of Harpring and  Andrei Kirilenko , who had missed two games with an ankle injury. Kirilenko had seven points, six assists, five rebounds and two blocks. Millsap has had a double-double in every game since scoring 21 and grabbing 10 boards against Chicago on Nov. 24. He had never had more than five assists before Friday. "Once I got going and started running, it felt good," Millsap said. "In college, I didn't pass too much. I had to try to take advantage of guys. I think this might be my career high in assists -- ever." After falling behind 6-0, the Jazz pulled away with a 17-0 run and led 33-23 entering the second period. Utah led 64-48 at halftime, then opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer by  C.J. Miles , a putback by Paul Millsap and a jumper by Okur for a 71-48 lead. Toronto didn't score in the period until Bosh tipped in a rebound with 9:41 to remaining. Miles ended the period with a left-handed, underhand layup while crossing the lane and the Jazz led 91-67 after three. "We ran our offense. The only times we really get in trouble is when we kind of get one-on-one," Harpring said. "If we don't just take the first shot, trust the offense and cut and move, we can get so many layups." Game notes  Millsap's previous high for assists was five. ... Millsap had only three career starts entering the season. ... Kirilenko had six of Utah's 31 assists. ... The Raptors shot 23.5 percent (4-for-17) on 3-pointers.
