MILWAUKEE (AP) --  Mike Dunleavy  came up with another big game to help the  Indiana Pacers  stay in the playoff chase. Dunleavy had 27 points and 11 rebounds and the Pacers kept their faint postseason hopes alive by edging the  Milwaukee Bucks  105-101 on Friday night. "At this point in the season, if you still have a chance to get in there, there's tons of motivation," Dunleavy said. "There's six games to go now. Hey, we're mathematically alive, so we have got to keep fighting." Indiana pulled within three games of Atlanta for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Hawks lost 109-104 to the  Philadelphia 76ers . "Michael has had an extraordinary year for us," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "Everything we have asked him to do, he has done at a very high level. He's a clutch performer." Dunleavy, who had 12 points in the fourth, made a huge 3-pointer after the Bucks cut it to 84-82 midway through the quarter. Dunleavy's two free throws made it 98-89 with just under 3 minutes to play. The Bucks didn't quit, though. Ramon Sessions  came off the bench to spark the Bucks in the closing seconds with two layups and a free throw.  Michael Redd , who led Milwaukee with 28 points, converted a layup with 11.4 seconds left to cut Indiana's lead to three, but Dunleavy made one of two free throws to seal the victory. "There were a lot of runs, so we couldn't really ever put them out of reach," Dunleavy said. "They didn't stop fighting." Neither did Dunleavy. "Mike is the most improved player," teammate  Jermaine O'Neal  said. "What Mike did tonight, I wasn't surprised because I have seen him do it all year." In the third quarter, the scoreboard flashed the Philadelphia score, but the Pacers didn't care. "We shouldn't need any more motivation to play hard," said O'Neal, who had 11 points and six turnovers in his third game back after missing 33 with a sore left knee. "We put ourselves in a tough situation. When we see a team like Atlanta lose that's been hot, it makes that game count that much more." Troy Murphy  scored 17 points and  Danny Granger  added 13 for Indiana, which has missed the playoffs the last two seasons. The Pacers have six games remaining, including matchups with the Bucks on Sunday and the Hawks on Tuesday night. Andrew Bogut  added 21 points and 16 rebounds for Milwaukee. Bobby Simmons  made two free throws to cut Indiana's lead to 77-75 but Dunleavy hit a 3-pointer from the left corner with 9:10 to go. Dunleavy's three-point play gave Indiana a 13-point lead late in the second quarter, and the Pacers led 53-46 at the half.
