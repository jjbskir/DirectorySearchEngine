LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For the second time in this young season, the
Clippers'  Elton Brand  scored only eight points. That was plenty. His Los Angeles teammates provided a fine balance of scoring in
a 102-89 victory over the  Portland Trail Blazers  on Monday night. "I feel bad for the people who have fantasy teams, but that's
about it," Brand said after taking just eight shots. "We're
winning the ball game. Tonight I didn't hit much, but before
tonight I was shooting over 56 percent from the field, so when I
did touch it, it's going in. "There are a lot of double- and triple-teams, but we have a lot
of offensive threats." Brand, who had four rebounds and four assists, was more of a
factor on defense, blocking five shots. He averaged 24.7 points and 10 rebounds last season. "You're expecting him to score 30 points on double-teams; it's
not going to happen," teammate  Sam Cassell  said. "We have a lot
of options and we're going to exercise them. But for us to be
successful throughout the season, he's definitely the main focus of
our team." Brand, who scored eight points in a win over Denver on Thursday,
had 15 in the Clippers' victory over Phoenix on Saturday night, so
he still has not been held to consecutive single-digit scoring
games since March 2004. Corey Maggette , who has agreed to a reserve role for the season,
topped the Clippers against Portland with 20 points and had nine
rebounds in his 28 minutes. Cuttino Mobley  had 17 points for Los Angeles, while Cassell had
16.  Chris Kaman  added 15 and nine rebounds for the Clippers and
 Quinton Ross  had 13 points. The Clippers (3-1) won their third in a row, all at home, and
beat Portland for the fifth consecutive meeting. Los Angeles' victory overshadowed a 35-point, 13-rebound
performance by Portland's  Zach Randolph , who also blocked three
shots. "I did better in the second half on getting the ball out
quick," said Randolph, alluding to times when he was
double-teamed. "It's something we work on in practice, getting the
ball out quick and finding an open man." Portland coach Nate McMillan was impressed by Randolph's play,
saying, "I thought he was fabulous with his post presence." The Trail Blazers, already missing starting center Joel
Przybilla, may lose guard Brandon Roy for a while. Roy played just
14 minutes before telling McMillan he couldn't go any more. "I didnt get hurt tonight," Roy said. "I have been having
some difficulty lately. A bone next to my Achilles' is bothering
me. "It just hurt too much to play. The doctor said I needed to
rest and get it looked at. I am going to have an MRI tomorrow when
I get back to Portland." Przybilla is expected to be sidelined for about a week by a
lower abdominal injury.  Jamaal Magloire , who came from Milwaukee in
the offseason, started at center against Los Angeles and had four
points and three rebounds in 23 minutes. Ime Udoka  had 10 points and 11 rebounds in the loss, and Jarrett
Jack finished with 17 points, only seven after the first quarter. Los Angeles took command with a 10-point burst over the final
3:55 of the third quarter and Portland got no closer than nine
points in the fourth. <
