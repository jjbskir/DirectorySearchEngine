ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Stan Van Gundy looked furious, and sounded worse. His  Orlando Magic  have lost six of eight, and Friday night allowed their second career high in a week.  Paul Millsap  had a career-best 28 points and the  Utah Jazz  broke a seven-game road losing streak with a 113-94 victory. "We're absolutely frightened of contact -- frightened," Van Gundy said. "We won't put our body in front of anybody driving the ball to the basket. We don't screen anybody, we won't block anybody out. It's a soft team, and until they change the results won't change." The Magic, who looked like one of the NBA's best teams after going 13-4 in November, haven't won a home game since Nov. 24, and are now 5-6 at Amway Arena. They left the court to a chorus of boos from the few fans who stayed to the end. "I feel bad for our fans," Van Gundy said. "I would have booed a lot louder than that. ... And I hope they will, if they put out the same effort the next time we're here." The Jazz hadn't won a road game since Nov. 28, but made this one look easy. Utah's reserves, including Millsap, outscored Orlando's 50-20, and  Carlos Boozer  had 24 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.  Deron Williams  had 17 points and seven assists,  Andrei Kirilenko  scored 18 and  Matt Harpring  and  C.J. Miles  each added 10. "We executed our offense better than we've done in I don't know how long," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "We had good shots, good chances to offensively rebound the ball and kept them from getting every shot they wanted." Hedo Turkoglu  scored a season-high 27 for Orlando and  Dwight Howard  had 20 points and 13 rebounds.  Rashard Lewis  scored seven in the first quarter, but ended up with just 12. He shot 2-for-7 from 3-point range. The Magic shot well early, taking an eight-point lead. But the Jazz closed the first quarter with a 13-4 run to take a 28-27 lead. The game stayed close until the third quarter, when Millsap took over. He scored all Utah's points in an 11-2 run over 4:03. It put the Jazz up 77-67, and Orlando got no closer in the fourth quarter. "I was trying to be more aggressive and assertive on the court," Millsap said. "Guys were just finding me through he seams." Harpring was back in the lineup after missing three straight with stomach trouble, but the Jazz were still missing  Mehmet Okur , out since Dec. 11 with a strained left trapezius. Jazz guard  Gordan Giricek  was not with the team, two nights after Sloan banished him to the locker room following a tense exchange on the bench. Giricek flew back to Utah on Thursday and the Jazz have said nothing further about his status. Orlando is now 4-6 in December, while Utah is 3-8. The Jazz had lost eight of their last nine. Game notes  Orlando turned the ball over 20 times for 30 Utah points, while the Jazz had 13 turnovers for 12 points. ... Magic G  Carlos Arroyo  returned after missing five games (left foot). He didn't play until the fourth quarter, when the Magic were down by double digits.
