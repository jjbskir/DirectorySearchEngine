CLEVELAND --  LeBron James  did not lead the Cavaliers in scoring, rebounds, assists, dunks or anything vital. And this time, it didn't matter. Zydrunas Ilgauskas  scored 16 points with a season-high 16 rebounds,  Larry Hughes  added 15 points and Cleveland hardly needed James in an easy 94-77 victory over the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Wednesday night. James scored 11 points -- three above his season low and 15 below his average -- and spent the first half of the fourth quarter watching as the scuffling Cavaliers, who came in just 4-8 since Jan. 16, won their fifth straight at home against the Clippers. "Guys took advantage of what we had," James said. "I didn't struggle at all. I didn't force anything. I took what was there. Defensively, we took care of business." Sasha Pavlovic  added 16 points and  Drew Gooden  had 13 for Cleveland, which held the Clippers to 35 percent shooting and without a field goal for a nearly nine-minute stretch bridging the third and fourth quarters. "We're trying to figure out ways to score and get stops when LeBron doesn't have one of his normal nights," Cavs coach Mike Brown said. "It's kind of been by committee." Elton Brand  led Los Angeles with 21 points and  Shaun Livingston  added 19 for the Clippers, who have dropped three in a row. In the aftermath of a stinging loss to Detroit on Sunday, both James and Hughes said the Cavaliers should be running more, their argument being the team is better suited for an up-tempo offensive game than the slowdown style preferred by Brown, who preaches defense first. The Cavs pushed the action when they could, attacking the rim when the opportunity was there. "It's no secret that I like to play that way," Hughes said. "I like to get up and run. So whenever we can get out and attack a team from start to finish, I think it works best in our favor." While there was no drastic change in their offense, the Cavaliers did do something different: They made a few more free throws, going 21-of-28 (75 percent) from the line. Cleveland has been the NBA's worst free-throw shooting team all season and came in making just 68 percent of its attempts. Leading by 11 at halftime and 13 after three quarters, the Cavaliers pushed their lead to 21 with 5:15 remaining when James drilled a 3-pointer. With upcoming games later this week against Miami and the  Los Angeles Lakers , the Cavs, now 7-1 at home against Western Conference teams, needed a relaxing night and the Clippers seemed only too willing to give them one. Playing the second game of a back-to-back after losing in New York on Tuesday, the Clippers had early energy and then faded. "To be a quality team in this league, you have to be consistent about stuff you do," guard  Sam Cassell  said. "Right now, we're not having that consistency." Los Angeles forward  Corey Maggette  was inactive, one day after he criticized coach Mike Dunleavy following the club's loss in New York. Maggette, second on the team in scoring and rebounding, was unhappy about playing just 17 minutes against the Knicks, who overcame a 10-point deficit to win. "It's just more of Dunleavy's [stuff] again," said Maggette, who recently had a meeting with owner Donald Sterling, Dunleavy and general manager Elgin Baylor to end trade speculation about the seven-year veteran. "I don't get it, I really don't. It's crazy. I put in work. I deserve to play. It's totally mind-boggling to me." The Clippers said Maggette was out with the flu. The Cavaliers were just 1-of-13 to open the second quarter before Ilgauskas hit a jumper to snap a 35-all tie. Hughes then scored nine straight points and Cleveland closed the period with a 10-2 spurt to open a 54-43 halftime lead. Game notes  Clippers forward  Tim Thomas  hyperextended his right knee in the third quarter but returned after getting the injury wrapped. ... Cavs guard  Damon Jones  has spent the past few days practicing for the 3-point contest during All-Star Weekend by shooting off racks of balls. He's not officially entered but that word should come Thursday from the NBA. Jones is already predicting victory. "I will win," he said. "There is no doubt about it." Jones went only 1-for-6, launching three attempts during one possession in the second half. ... It was the 500th career start for Ilgauskas. Only Brad Daugherty (548) has started more games for the Cavs. ... Ohio State football stars Troy Smith and Ted Ginn Jr. were honored during halftime ceremonies as part of the Cavs' black heritage celebration.
