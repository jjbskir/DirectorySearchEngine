HOUSTON -- Just when the  Miami Heat  were getting back on track, they may have lost the person they can least afford to be without. Dwyane Wade  dislocated his left shoulder late in Miami's 112-102 loss to the  Houston Rockets  on Wednesday night, though the extent of his injury is not yet known. With  Shaquille O'Neal  finally healthy and Pat Riley back on the bench, the Heat seemed poised to shake off their early struggles and surge in the second half of the season.
