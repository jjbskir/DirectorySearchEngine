LOS ANGELES (AP) --  Kobe Bryant  bringing the ball upcourt and  Lamar Odom  working inside and outside proved an unbeatable combination for the  Los Angeles Lakers . Bryant scored 21 points and Odom had 20 points and 16 rebounds in a 91-81 victory over the hapless  Memphis Grizzlies  on Sunday night in Phil Jackson's 500th game as Lakers' coach. "That's what we need, that 1-2 punch," Bryant said. "We'll continue to provide that." Andrew Bynum  added 11 points,  Smush Parker  scored 10 and Odom had seven assists as the Lakers ended a two-game losing streak. Asked if it was his best game so far, Odom replied: "If you're stat watching, maybe, but it's the team effort that counts. We could've played better in the second half, but we gave ourselves enough of a cushion to sustain a victory." Mike Miller  scored 21 points -- tying his career high with six 3-pointers -- and had 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who lost their fourth in a row overall and third straight on the road. They have yet to beat a Western Conference opponent. "We played a good third quarter and put 32 points on the board, but when you go down 19 to a quality team on the road, it's tough to come back," Miller said. "That's been the story of our season so far." Even Miller's long-range success couldn't overcome Memphis' 38.4 field-goal percentage, which ranks last in the NBA. "We have stretches in every game where we just don't score the ball and you have to overcome those," Memphis coach Mike Fratello said. "It makes it a little easier if you can single a guy out and say, `Here's the ball, go get us a shot.' That doesn't happen all the time right now, so we have a lot to work on." The Lakers frittered away most of a 19-point halftime lead in the fourth quarter, when the Grizzlies got within seven. "It just seems like we can never get over the hump,"  Chucky Atkins  said. "We can never make that shot or play or get that rebound that will put us over the top." Reserve  Damon Stoudamire , who scored 16 points, hit a 3-pointer to pull Memphis within six. But Bryant scored the Lakers' final seven points -- on a 3-pointer, a jumper in the lane and two free throws -- to close out the sloppy win. "We had a good first half," Jackson said. "I'm not so pleased with the second half. It looked like it was hard for us to sustain the effort." The Grizzlies trailed 72-62 to start the fourth quarter. They ran off 10 in a row -- four each by  Hakim Warrick  and Stoudamire -- to get to 79-72. Parker made one of two free throws and then missed a jumper before  Maurice Evans ' fast-break reverse dunk pushed the Lakers' lead to 82-72 with 5:38 remaining. Bryant started the final 12 minutes on the bench with the usual wrap around his surgically repaired right knee. He returned four minutes in and made a nifty bounce pass in the lane to a driving Parker, whose layup again kept the Lakers ahead by 10. Memphis outscored Los Angeles 32-23 in the third, when Miller hit three 3-pointers and Bryant was limited to four points. Game notes  The Lakers are off until Friday when they host Toronto. ...
