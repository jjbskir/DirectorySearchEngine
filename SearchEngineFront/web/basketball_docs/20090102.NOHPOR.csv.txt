PORTLAND, Ore. -- The  New Orleans Hornets  didn't unravel after  Tyson Chandler  was kicked out. Instead, they regrouped. David West  had 25 points,  Chris Paul  added 17 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds and the Hornets beat the stunned  Portland Trail Blazers  92-77 on Friday night. West and Paul teamed to lead New Orleans' rally, with the Hornets outscoring Portland 41-19 in the final 15 minutes for their fourth straight win. But Paul gave the credit to Chandler, who was ejected after a third-quarter tussle with  Joel Przybilla . "I think we fed off that energy," the All-Star guard said. "We were talking in the huddle and that's what really hyped the game up. We got excited after that." Rudy Fernandez  led Portland with 19 points.  Travis Outlaw  added 16, and  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Blazers, who were held to their second-lowest points total of the season. "They totally controlled the game," Przybilla said. "Unfortunately, they followed their game plan and we didn't follow ours." For the second game, Portland was without  Brandon Roy , who has been hobbled by a strained right hamstring and averaged 24.5 points in the first two meetings between the teams this season. The Hornets won 87-82 in New Orleans on Nov. 14, and the Blazers won 101-86 Nov. 28 at the Rose Garden, where they are 12-4 this season. The Hornets, who were beginning a four-game road trip, led at the half 45-43, but Portland led 58-51 with 2:59 left in the third. The turning point came when Przybilla and Chandler tangled up and nearly began fighting. Przybilla shoved Chandler with a forearm in the abdomen, which caused Chandler to lunge forward and smack Przybilla with a harder, more blatant forearm. Officials Sean Corbin and Gary Zielinski, working as a two-man crew with Jack Nies missing the game due to injury, watched the replay screen before deciding to eject Chandler for a flagrant-2 foul. It was the third time that seven-year veteran has been ejected in Portland. "We had a five-point lead after Tyson Chandler was ejected," Portland coach  Nate McMillan  said. "I felt that would give us momentum. Instead it was the Hornets who were energized. New Orleans made 13 of 19 shots in the fourth quarter against a sagging Portland defense. Posey keyed a 23-7 run with three 3-pointers and Paul converted two driving layups and a 3 to put New Orleans up 77-67 with 5:05 left in the game.  Hilton Armstrong  entered the game for Chandler and scored 10 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter. "I thought they all kept their composure -- everybody but Tyson probably," Hornets coach  Byron Scott  said. "We got a little from everybody, which I thought was important."
