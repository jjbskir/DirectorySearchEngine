MILWAUKEE (AP) -- It's been a dream week for  Michael Redd  and the  Milwaukee Bucks . Redd scored 27 points and made five late free throws to lead the Bucks over the  Dallas Mavericks , 97-95 on Saturday night. Andrew Bogut  had 16 points and 14 rebounds, and  Mo Williams  added 19 points as the Bucks won their fifth straight overall and improved to 6-0 at home. The win also snapped a three-game losing streak to Dallas. It's been one of the best stretches for the Bucks in a long time. On Tuesday, they beat the  Cleveland Cavaliers  on the road, then upended the  Los Angeles Lakers  on Wednesday and now the Mavericks. "Our team is doing a terrific job being unselfish, playing the right way and we're defending," Redd said. "That's the ultimate key." Josh Howard  had 24 points and 11 rebounds for Dallas, which lost its second consecutive game.  Dirk Nowitzki  added 20 points and  Jason Terry , who had one point in the first half, finished with 21. His 17 points in the final 4:14 almost rescued the Mavericks, but Redd's free throws preserved the victory. Howard said that it's too early for Dallas to panic. "It's still a learning process for us," he said. "This group of guys has been together for about three years now and we know what it takes to win." There were 10 ties and 15 lead changes, including five in the last three minutes before the Bucks went ahead to stay with 1:26 to play. "It was Saturday night at the fights," Bucks coach Larry Krystowiak said. "It was kind of like a heavyweight fight. It went 15 rounds." Williams made two free throws after being fouled by Terry. Redd hit one after being fouled by  Devin Harris . Bogut put back a rebound and  Yi Jianlian  made a free throw to put Milwaukee ahead 92-87. After Terry hit a 3-pointer, Nowitzki fouled Redd who missed the first, but made the second throw before Terry hit from 12-feet out. If Redd was flustered, he didn't show it as he was immediately fouled on the next possession and sank the two free throws. "I kept saying in the huddle that we had to stay aggressive," Redd said. "Eventually, it will come out our way, and it did. We can't get frustrated with the referees and get foolish technicals." The Mavericks set Terry up for a 3-pointer to tie the game with just under 10 seconds left, but he missed. "I had a great look," Terry said who was 7-of-15 from the floor and 6-of-10 from 3-point range. "It just didn't go down." Redd grabbed Terry's errant shot and was fouled, putting him on the line for the last time. He made both free throws for Milwaukee's final points. Terry hit a three at the buzzer for the final score. "Shooters keep shooting and that was my motto tonight," Terry said. The game featured a rematch of sorts for Yi and Nowitzki. The two 7-footers faced each other while playing for their respective countries in an invitational two-game series on August 18-19 in Mannheim, Germany. Nowitzki helped Germany, which was preparing for the 2007 European Championship, sweep Yi's Chinese team before it headed to a tournament in Turkey. Yi had nine points, seven rebounds, two assists, a blocked shot and one turnover in almost 32 minutes. Nowitzki grabbed three rebounds, had three assists, a turnover and a blocked shot in 34 minutes. The game became a lot more physical after Dallas had to take two quick timeouts late in the first quarter. First, Bogut knocked Nowitzki to the floor as the Dallas forward drove to the hoop. Nowitzki held his head for a moment before getting up under his own power. On Dallas' next possession,  Bobby Simmons  collided with Howard, who landed awkwardly and got up limping. Williams' 3-pointer with 6:37 to play gave the Bucks their biggest lead at 75-70, but Nowitzki answered with a 3. Dallas regained the lead on their next possession when Terry hit a 3-pointer and  Brandon Bass  added four of his 12 points. Howard's 3-pointer made it 66-62 at the end of three. Nowitzki connected from behind the arc with 7:50 left in the third for the first 3-pointer in the game.
