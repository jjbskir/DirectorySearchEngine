CHICAGO (AP) --  Ben Wallace  showed why the  Chicago Bulls  wanted him on their side. Wallace had eight points and 18 rebounds as the Bulls beat the  Indiana Pacers  89-80 on Saturday night. Kirk Hinrich  scored 23 points and  Luol Deng  added 21 for Chicago, which bounced back from a lopsided defeat at Cleveland on Thursday night. Chicago shot only 38 percent, but Wallace, who played the entire game, gave the Bulls plenty of second chances with 10 offensive rebounds. Chicago signed Wallace to a four-year, $60 million deal in the offseason. The four-time Defensive Player of the Year with Detroit showed how big of an impact he could make for Chicago. "This is what we've been dealing with four times a year. He's a beast in there," Hinrich said. "He's always throwing his body around, getting his hands on balls, rebounding, kicking it out and giving us so many extra opportunities. He was definitely huge for us tonight." Al Harrington  scored 19 points for the Pacers and  Danny Granger  added 18. The Bulls fought back from a 68-60 deficit early in the fourth quarter. Wallace had consecutive baskets for Chicago and  Chris Duhon  found Deng for an alley-oop dunk to cut Indiana's lead to 69-68 with 7:57 left. Then Hinrich's jumper gave the Bulls a 70-69 lead with 7:27 left, Chicago's first lead of the second half. "For me, I'm just trying to do whatever I can do to help this team win," Wallace said. "Whether it's rebound, defend, try to play the passing lanes, try to get stops, whatever. Whatever I can do I'll do to help this team win." Harrington made a pair of free throws and  Jermaine O'Neal  hit a jumper to put Indiana back up 73-70. But the Bulls started to outhustle the Pacers, who were coming off a 93-83 victory over Orlando on Friday night in Indianapolis. Deng's tip-in tied the game at 75 and then he hit two free throws to give Chicago a 77-75 lead. O'Neal tied it at 77 with 2:36 left, but the Bulls took the lead for good when O'Neal was called for goaltending on Wallace's shot and Duhon had a putback with 1:26 left to make it 81-77. Granger hit a 3 for Indiana with 34 seconds left, but Hinrich answered with a 3 to put the Bulls up 84-80 with 19 to go. Deng also had 12 rebounds and  Andres Nocioni  added 12 points for Chicago. "The offensive rebounds killed us," Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. "They had eight offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter. Overall, they had a 24-4 advantage on the offensive boards, that's hard to overcome regardless of how hard you play." Trailing 36-27 in the second quarter, Indiana outscored Chicago 21-7 to close out the half and take a 48-43 lead. Granger hit back-to-back 3s for Indiana during the span and finished the half with 12 points. Harrington added 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting in the half. Hinrich led the Bulls with 10 points in the half. The Bulls will start a stretch of seven consecutive road games, beginning on Tuesday in Dallas.
