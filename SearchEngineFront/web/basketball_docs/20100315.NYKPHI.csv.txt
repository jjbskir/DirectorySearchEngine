PHILADELPHIA --  Toney Douglas  is making a strong case to remain in the starting lineup. The rookie guard from Florida State had a solid all-around effort for the second consecutive game, and the  New York Knicks  won both of them. Danilo Gallinari  scored 21 points, Douglas added 20 and the Knicks won their second straight on the road by rallying past the struggling  Philadelphia 76ers , 94-84 on Monday night. Al Harrington  contributed 15,  Tracy McGrady  scored 14 and  Wilson Chandler  had 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Knicks (24-43), who snapped the  Dallas Mavericks ' 13-game win streak with a convincing 128-94 victory last Saturday. Douglas had 21 points and eight assists against the Mavericks. This time against Philadelphia, he finished with seven assists and scored nine points in the fourth quarter. "The coaches have a lot of confidence in me," Douglas said. "I have confidence in myself. I feel comfortable." Douglas shot 7 for 13 and hit all four of his free throws in nearly 37 minutes. "When Toney was on the court, we played a lot better," Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. "He hit a big 3-pointer for us and played with a lot of energy." David Lee  grabbed 16 rebounds as the Knicks improved to 2-2 on this five-game road trip. "I thought our defense was a lot better in the second half," D'Antoni said. Jrue Holiday  scored 18 points,  Willie Green  added 17 and  Andre Iguodala  had 14 points and a career-high 17 rebounds for the Sixers (23-44), who have dropped five in a row and 10 of their last 11. The Sixers are just 10-22 at home. Samuel Dalembert  had 11 points and 18 rebounds for Philadelphia. "We had open looks," Sixers coach Eddie Jordan said. "We couldn't make shots." After Holiday made a layup to get Philadelphia within 85-82 with 3:47 left, Douglas knocked down a 19-foot jumper and Gallinari connected on two free throws for an 89-82 advantage with 2:03 remaining. "They tell me to shoot when I'm open," Douglas said. "We made some big shots as a team." Iguodala missed a runner in the lane and Gallinari responded with a 3-pointer for a 10-point lead. The 7-0 run sealed New York's second consecutive win in Philadelphia for the first time since 2004. Iguodala shot only 5 of 22 and missed all seven of his 3-pointers. Over his last four games, Iguodala is 1 for 19 from 3-point territory. "He's human," Jordan said. Trailing by nine points midway through the third quarter, the Knicks went on an 11-0 run to take a 67-65 lead with 2:31 remaining. Harrington scored five points during the spurt. Dalembert kept the Sixers close with nine rebounds in the third, giving him 16 total. But Philadelphia fell behind 73-69. "We have to find a way to make shots," Dalembert said. "We missed way too many open looks." In the first half, Green scored 15 points on 7-for-15 shooting as the Sixers took a 55-44 lead into the locker room.
