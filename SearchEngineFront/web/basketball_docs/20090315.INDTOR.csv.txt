 Bargnani scored 27 points, Bosh had 15 points and 13 rebounds and the Raptors used a big second half to beat the  Indiana Pacers  110-87 on Sunday, snapping a seven-game losing streak with their biggest margin of victory this season. "We really need to take something from it," Bosh said. "This time we can take a positive from this whole game instead of trying to make something good out of a loss." Pops Mensah-Bonsu  scored a career-high 21 points and  Jose Calderon  added 15 points and 12 assists for Toronto, which had not won since a 118-110 home victory over Minnesota on Feb. 24. "We just needed to win," Calderon said. "We've been playing better the last couple of games and we couldn't finish. Today we played for 48 minutes and we have to keep working from here." The unheralded Mensah-Bonsu had four dunks among his five baskets, went 11-for-13 from the line and added eight rebounds. "He had the game of his life against us," Indiana swingman  Danny Granger  said. "Hats off to him but we can't really let that happen." Troy Murphy  had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, with  T.J. Ford  adding 15 and  Jarrett Jack  13. "They basically punched us in the face," Indiana's  Jeff Foster  said. "It's embarrassing. We got beat in every phase of the game." Granger returned from an 11-game absence, coming off the bench in the first quarter and finishing with 10 points in limited action. "I played 18 minutes, I thought I had played 32," Granger said. "That's how it feels but it will come around. It just takes a while to get back into the rhythm." Out since Feb. 18 because of a partially torn tendon in his right foot, Granger is expected to start Wednesday when the Pacers host Portland. The Pacers shot 19-for-43 in the first half but fell apart in the second, going 13-for-42. "They played a really great game. They just pounded us in every area," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "We had no answer for them today." Indiana, which entered play Sunday two games out of the East's final playoff spot, has dropped three straight and four of five. "What a bad second half we produced," Ford said. "It's tough when we're fighting for a playoff spot. In the second half our effort was awful." Marion scored the highlight basket of the game, taking a pass from Bargnani and soaring over Granger for a one-handed fast-break dunk in the third, then heading to the line to complete the three-point play. Marion converted an alley-oop pass from Calderon on the next possession, putting Toronto up 73-63 and forcing the Pacers to call timeout. "I've been telling him I want to see some of those highlights I used to see when he was in Phoenix," Mensah-Bonsu said. "He keeps telling me he's old but I told him he's still got it and, like you saw today, he still does." Bosh sensed that Marion's explosive spurt would be enough to turn the tide in Toronto's favor, and made sure he told his teammates. "I said that was the turning point," Bosh said. "Everybody had a lot of energy. You could feel it in the crowd, you could feel it from us and I just told everybody, 'Hey, we've got to keep this going. We really have to take advantage of this." Marion scored all 10 of his points in the third as the Raptors outscored the Pacers 37-19 to take a 90-69 edge into the fourth. "Everything that could have gone wrong for us out there happened in that third quarter," Murphy said. Indiana led 26-24 after the first and opened a 44-37 lead with 5:23 left in the half before the Raptors rallied. Bargnani's 3-pointer with 1:50 left put Toronto in front. Bargnani shot 6-for-7 in the half and scored 16 points as the Raptors closed the second on a 14-3 run to lead 53-50 at the break.
