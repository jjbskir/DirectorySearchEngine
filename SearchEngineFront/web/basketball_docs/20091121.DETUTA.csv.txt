SALT LAKE CITY --  Andrei Kirilenko  and the  Utah Jazz  outlasted the  Detroit Pistons  for their fourth straight victory. Kirilenko scored six of his 22 points in overtime and the Jazz beat the Pistons 100-97 on Saturday night.  Carlos Boozer  scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half and overtime to help the Jazz escape a back-and-forth game that produced 17 lead changes and saw no lead larger than five points after halftime. "It was a tough game for us," said Jazz guard  Deron Williams , who finished with 11 assists. "We had to win it on the defensive end and that's what we did." "I thought Andrei had a great game off the bench," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "Boozer made all these free throws and made some key baskets to help us win the ball game." Boozer was 10 for 10 from the free-throw line and the Jazz capitalized on a large free-throw disparity. They shot 19 more and made 12 more than Detroit. Utah shot 75 percent from line and made its final eight, including all six in overtime. "Defensively we did a nice job, especially at their house," Pistons coach John Kuester said, "but they got to the foul line 44 times to our 25. So that hurt." Detroit's  Ben Gordon  scored 25 points, but missed a potential tying 3-pointer in the final second after two Kirilenko free throws put Utah ahead with 9.8 seconds remaining. Detroit's  Rodney Stuckey  scored 18 points, and  Charlie Villanueva  had 17 points in the Pistons' fourth consecutive loss. Detroit shot 45 percent from the field, but made just two of nine shots in overtime. The Pistons held a four-point lead after three quarters. Paul Millsap  missed a jumper at the buzzer in regulation after Gordon's two free throws tied it at 90 with 22.1 seconds left. Utah dressed just nine players and was without starting center  Mehmet Okur  (flu).
