TORONTO (AP) --  Chris Bosh  did his part to end Toronto's slump. He would like the fans to do theirs. Bosh had 32 points and 11 rebounds and the Raptors ended a three-game losing streak with a 111-93 victory over the  Milwaukee Bucks  on Wednesday night. Anthony Parker  added 18 points for the Raptors, who have struggled despite clinching a playoff spot last week. Toronto lost 15 of its previous 21 games. Fans booed the Raptors after their last home loss and didn't make much noise Wednesday night. "It was quiet. Could you hear yourself talk?" Bosh asked reporters. "We're getting ready for the playoffs. I'm just saying I'm excited. I don't know if anybody else is excited, but I'm excited. I'm not waiting for next week. I'm trying to do it right now and that's the mentality we need to take, the whole organization, the whole building." Bosh said a loud building makes a difference. "When you go to places like Dallas, Utah, Detroit and Cleveland it's loud," Bosh said. "It really gives them an advantage." The Raptors won the Atlantic Division last season, but are just 39-39 this season. Fans seem worried. "We needed a win,"  Jose Calderon  said. "Everybody has a little more confidence. We have to take it one at a time, step by step. We have four games left. We're going to be all right." Former Raptor  Charlie Villanueva  had a season-high 38 points and a career-high seven 3-pointers. He scored 25 of Milwaukee's first 29 points. Villanueva, traded to Milwaukee after Toronto drafted  Andrea Bargnani  with the No. 1 pick in 2006, blew his fingers after making his third straight 3-pointer in the second quarter. The Raptors called timeout. Villanueva had 27 points and nine rebounds in the first 16 minutes, but wasn't a factor again until it was too late in the fourth quarter. He finished 14-for-25 from the field and grabbed 12 rebounds. "Every time I come here I feel like I got something to prove. It's just the way I feel," Villanueva said. "I was having fun out there. I was having a good time. It definitely feels good to go at the team that traded you." Bosh gave Toronto a 12 point lead in the third by capping an 11-0 run with a 16-foot jumper and a 3 pointer. Former Bucks point guard  T.J. Ford , acquired in the Villanueva trade, had 10 points in the third as Toronto outscored Milwaukee 33-20 in the quarter. Parker's driving layup and 3-pointer gave Toronto a 16-point lead with 2:45 left in the fourth. Bargnani struggled with his jumper again, but made two nice drives for a dunk and a layup in the fourth. He finished with 10 points in just 23 minutes. Toronto held Milwaukee to 42 percent shooting. Michael Redd  had 17 points. "Charlie had a great night but we did a great job on Michael Redd and the rest of their guys," Toronto coach Sam Mitchell said.
