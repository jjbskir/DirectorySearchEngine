OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- It might have been easy for the  Orlando Magic  of old to melt down in a game like this, and go home satisfied with a 3-2 road trip. This team doesn't settle for any such thing. After  Dwight Howard  nearly cost the Magic the game in the final minute of regulation, he helped them win in overtime. Howard scored four of his 18 points in the extra session and the NBA's top road team pulled off a hard-fought 123-117 victory over Golden State on Monday night to snap the Warriors' six-game winning streak. "We trust each other. That's the main thing," said  Rashard Lewis , a key figure late in the game for Orlando. "We have trust in a lot of guys on this team. That's why we're coming up big in a lot of games." Howard missed a dunk with 18.7 seconds left in regulation and was fouled, but smacked the padding on the basket standard for an automatic technical.  Stephen Jackson  hit a free throw for the infraction, then Howard converted both of his chances from the stripe -- on a play that sent Golden State star  Baron Davis  to the bench for good with his sixth foul. But  Monta Ellis  missed the first of two free throws with 17.4 seconds left and a 3-pointer at the buzzer. That came after Lewis made two free throws for the Magic to tie the game at 109 with 13.4 seconds left. Jackson scored all 25 of his points after halftime in only the Warriors' second defeat in 11 games since an 0-6 start. "I thought it was a great game," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "We certainly had a chance to win, put ourselves in a position to win. We were right there but we didn't. ... This is one of the best teams we've played." Jameer Nelson  had 22 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds,  Keith Bogans  also scored 22 points and Lewis added 20 for the Magic, who are 11-2 on the road this season and 16-4 overall under first-year coach Stan Van Gundy. Ellis finished with 22 points, a career-high 12 rebounds and seven assists and Davis scored 19 points to go with nine assists for the Warriors, who shot only 38 percent and went 9-for-40 from 3-point range. Lewis' 3-pointer tied the game at 105 with 1:10 to play in the fourth quarter, then  Hedo Turkoglu  missed a long 3 from the top of the arc with a chance to give the Magic a lead. Turkoglu fouled Jackson on the other end and he converted both free throws with 24.5 seconds left. Turkoglu finished with 17 points, eight rebounds and two steals. "I told them tonight that I was impressed," Van Gundy said. "I told them before the game if we win here tonight, it will be the best win of the year." Jackson missed his first seven shots before playing like the forward who earned Western Conference player of the week honors. Howard, who got the same recognition in the East last week, watched as Orlando blew a nine-point fourth-quarter lead. The Magic turned a five-point lead into a 90-81 cushion on one play with 11:24 left, when Turkoglu scored and was fouled and Nelson was whistled for a technical after apparently making it known he thought  Al Harrington  drew a charge. Then Golden State scored seven straight points, including Davis' three-point play to make it 90-88.  Andris Biedrins  had a three-point play to give Golden State a brief lead with 7:22 remaining. Biedrins had his fourth double-double in six games with 11 points and 15 rebounds. Both teams played on consecutive nights but looked plenty fresh after the Warriors won at Seattle and Orlando against the Lakers in Los Angeles. "They're a great team," Jackson said. "That's why they have a 16-4 record, because they shoot well." Lewis, the Magic's second-leading scorer behind Howard, didn't score his first points until making a running hook with 6:41 left in the second and Orlando led 57-48 at halftime. The Warriors shot 3-for-17 from 3-point range in the opening half. Adonal Foyle  returned to the Bay Area after the Warriors parted ways with the 10-year veteran and the team's longest-tenured player in August. Foyle had spent his entire career with Golden State, and received a warm welcome. A video tribute was shown for Foyle before the game and he waved in all directions to greet the crowd, which gave him a standing ovation. The video board read "Thanks for a decade of commitment." Game notes  Magic G  Carlos Arroyo  flew home to be with his ill daughter. ... Foyle followed a teammate to the visitors' locker room, having never set foot in there before. "Insane," Foyle said of coming back. "You can't believe it's been 10 years in one place. You can't just wash it away. It will always be part of you. ... I've never been to this side of the arena before. I didn't know this side of the arena existed." ... Warriors G/F  Mickael Pietrus  was inactive with a bruised nose after he took an elbow from Seattle's  Earl Watson  on Sunday night. ... Biedrins didn't start for only the third time in 17 games. ... The Magic are 12-2 when scoring 100 or more points. ... Former 49ers and Raiders defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield sat courtside.
