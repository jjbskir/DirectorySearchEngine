LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Everything went right for the  Detroit Pistons , while nothing much did for the  Los Angeles Lakers . Tayshaun Prince  tied his career high with 31 points,  Chauncey Billups  added 21 and the Pistons' zone stymied the Lakers in a 97-83 victory Friday night. "We got out and got some easy baskets early," Prince said. "I was just in a good rhythm all night." Kobe Bryant  led the Lakers with 19 points -- all but two coming in the fourth quarter after he was a non-factor for much of their second consecutive loss and first at home. He had 32 points in a loss at Portland on Wednesday, but his first basket Friday didn't come until 3  minutes before halftime. "We played terrible," Bryant said. "We kind of ran around like a chicken with our head cut off." Bryant was briefly on the bench in the fourth quarter, his right knee wrapped in a heat pad. He returned with eight minutes left and the Lakers down by 18. He ran off eight in a row, capped by a 3-pointer, that got the crowd into it, but still had his team trailing 85-68. "I felt OK," he said. "It was a little stiff. It's just not strong. I can't turn into sixth gear yet." Bryant took only four shots in the first three quarters. "He was labored," coach Phil Jackson said. "That's going to happen right now. We're not going to panic." Lamar Odom  had 16 points before being ejected with 2:16 left in the game. He tossed his wristbands toward the bench, triggering his second technical. "That was as bad a performance as I think we've had here in a long time," Jackson said. Rasheed Wallace  added 15 points for Detroit. Prince single-handedly torched the Lakers in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped Detroit build a 21-point lead. He reeled off nine in a row, at one point scoring over Bryant, who fell trying to defend. Consecutive 3-pointers by Odom in the closing seconds cut the Lakers' deficit to 15 heading into the final 12 minutes. "We just did a great job defensively of attacking and making them hit the outside shot," Prince said. "We haven't been getting out running and that's been our problem. It's been making our offense stagnant." Detroit had lost the first two games of its four-game West Coast trip, but the outcome was never in doubt against the Lakers, despite their brief late rally. Andrew Bynum , the Lakers' 19-year-old starting center, had his second straight poor game with six points and two rebounds. His lack of presence inside helped the Pistons dominate the boards, 49-32.  Antonio McDyess  had 12 rebounds and  Nazr Mohammed  added 10. "We wanted to go inside to Andrew and that cost us," Jackson said. "We lost the ball a number of times trying to do that." Game notes  Pistons G  Richard Hamilton  didn't play because of a hyperextended right elbow. He's listed as day-to-day.  Ronald Murray  started in his place. ... The Lakers didn't get C  Kwame Brown  back as expected. He missed his seventh consecutive game because of a bruised rotator cuff and bursitis in his right shoulder. He complained of shooting pain in his shoulder and neck after Thursday's practice. Jackson suggested Brown might return Sunday against Memphis, but Brown said he didn't think so. "I'm seeing the doctor on Monday," he said. "I'll sit back and get it all the way healthy." ... The Lakers had been 9-0 at home dating to last season. ... Oscar winners Jack Nicholson and Sean Penn sat side-by-side, with Nicholson getting louder cheers than Penn.
