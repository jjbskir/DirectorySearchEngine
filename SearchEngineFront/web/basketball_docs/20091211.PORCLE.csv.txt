CLEVELAND --  LeBron James  had another of those oh-no-he-didn't-type plays.  Shaquille O'Neal  didn't see it. James scored 33 points and made an incredible, soaring block on  Brandon Roy  in the final seconds, and  Anderson Varejao  had a season-high 22 as the  Cleveland Cavaliers  rebounded from consecutive sloppy road losses with a 104-99 win over the hobbled  Portland Trail Blazers  on Friday night.

    James added seven assists, seven rebounds and swatted Roy's shot with the Cavs holding on late. Portland's star tried to drop in a floater, but James came across the lane and rejected his shot, his fingers going above the backboard square -- 12 feet off the floor -- to send it into the seats. "I didn't see where the ball went," James said. "It's still rolling, that's a good thing." What's not so good is O'Neal leaving with a bruised left eye in the third quarter. Cleveland's center got poked by Portland's  Joel Przybilla  while going up for a shot. He was taken to the Cleveland Clinic after the game for precautionary tests and is expected to travel with the team to Oklahoma City on Saturday. O'Neal finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds and Varejao added 10 boards for Cleveland, which found itself trailing 54-45 after an uninspired first half. At the break, an angry coach  Mike Brown  laid into his players and they came out with much more intensity. "It was much needed," guard  Mo Williams  said of Brown's fiery pep talk. "We were lackadaisical. We weren't playing the way we should. He said the right things and got our motors going." Roy scored 23,  LaMarcus Aldridge  22 and  Andre Miller  20 for the Blazers, who dressed just nine players because of injuries and need to play better. "We have to or we'll get beat by 30," Roy said. "We have no room for error. At the beginning of the season, we thought we did. Now if we relax for one quarter, we can get blown out by any team." Varejao and Williams, who added 10 assists, were gametime decisions after suffering stomach-flu symptoms earlier in the day. And for a good portion of the first three quarters, the Cavaliers played sickly. But with James on the bench, Cleveland opened the fourth with an 8-2 spurt that seemed to put the Cavaliers in control. Cleveland eventually opened a 93-87 lead on  Anthony Parker 's 3-pointer, but the Trail Blazers wouldn't go away. Portland was within five when Roy tossed up his runner in the lane that James turned away with perhaps his defensive highlight of this season. "I saw him coming at the last minute, but I thought I got it close enough to the rim," said Roy, who didn't contest if it was goaltending. "No call, so it was a good block." Blazers interim coach Dean Demopoulos wasn't so sure James had gotten the ball on the way up. "I'll have to check the film," he said, smiling. "I don't make enough money get to fined, man." Even after James' defensive gem, the Blazers closed to 101-97 on Aldridge's 3-pointer and pulled within two when Roy sneaked behind James on the baseline, stole the ball and made a layup with 12.2 seconds remaining. "It was just miscommunication," James said. The Blazers were forced to foul and Williams and James combined for three free throws in the last 10 seconds to ice it. After giving up 31 points to Portland in the second quarter, the Cavs held the Blazers to 45 points in the second half. James scored 14 -- matching his total for the first half -- during a back-and-forth third quarter. Early in the period, James was the only Cavaliers player doing much of anything on offense and the Blazers took a 10-point lead on Roy's 3-pointer. But O'Neal began asserting himself down low like the Shaq of old and scored nine points during a 15-2 run that put Cleveland back in front. On one possession, O'Neal grabbed a loose ball, powered through two defenders and shook the backboard with a powerful dunk. This has been a tough week for the injury-ravaged Trail Blazers, who spent nearly as much time on the operating table as on the floor. Center  Greg Oden  underwent surgery on Dec. 6 to repair a left patella fracture, which will sideline him for the remainder of the season. The next day, coach  Nate McMillan  had surgery on his ruptured Achilles' tendon and  Rudy Fernandez  underwent a procedure to alleviate pain in his right leg. Game notes  Demopoulos is serving as head coach during McMillan's absence. Although he is not with the team, Portland's wins and losses will be credited to McMillan, not Demopoulos. ... Browns star Josh Cribbs received a huge ovation from the crowd, one night after he led Cleveland to an upset over the Pittsburgh Steelers. ... Cavs G  Daniel Gibson  sat out with a sprained right pinkie he injured at Houston. ... Cleveland's reserves contributed 35 points and 17 rebounds. In the past seven games, the Cavs' backups are averaging 38.6 points and 19.6 rebounds.
