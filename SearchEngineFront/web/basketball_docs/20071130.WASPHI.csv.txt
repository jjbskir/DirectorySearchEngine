PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A historically bad shooting night couldn't stop the  Philadelphia 76ers . The Sixers tied a dubious franchise record set Feb. 22, 1988, at Houston, by missing all 14 of their 3-pointers.  Andre Iguodala  misfired on 16 straight shots and wound up 3-for-19 from the field. However,  Samuel Dalembert  had 19 points and 11 rebounds and  Andre Miller  scored 18 points to lead the 76ers to an 85-84 victory over the  Washington Wizards  on Friday night. Willie Green  and  Reggie Evans  added 13 points each for the Sixers (5-10), who snapped a two-game losing streak at home and a four-game skid against the Wizards. "Overall, we are a good defensive team," Evans said. "We help each other out. Overall, we played good, solid defense and that's the way to get wins." Iguodala contributed eight points and 12 rebounds. "We're not going to shoot well all the time, so we have to find other ways to win," Dalembert said. Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks applauded his team's defense, especially in the second half. "I thought our defense was the reason why we won that game," Cheeks said. Caron Butler  scored 20 points while  Antawn Jamison  had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Washington, which fell to 7-9. The Wizards are 4-4 since  Gilbert Arenas  went down with a knee injury expected to sideline him for three months. Nick Young  scored 13 points while  DeShawn Stevenson  and  Antonio Daniels  had 10 apiece. "It wasn't a step back at all," Wizards coach Eddie Jordan said. "We just lost the game." The game was tied at 68-all after three quarters and remained close throughout the remainder of regulation with neither team gaining a big advantage. Despite playing in a half-empty arena, the crowd got loud as the Sixers snapped a 78-all tie and pulled ahead, 84-78, with 1:06 remaining. Dalembert hit a layup and two free throws during the key 6-0 spurt. The Wizards pulled to 85-84 and had a chance to win the game on their final possession. Stevenson passed the ball to Young, but he missed a 26-foot 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds left. The ball caromed away, and the buzzer sounded before the Wizards could put up another shot. "I thought it was a great shot," Young said. "It felt good coming out of my hand. It just didn't go down." Washington overcame an early 11-point deficit to take a 43-42 lead at halftime. Jamison had 12 points and  Brendan Haywood  blocked four shots in a five-minute span as the Wizards surged ahead.
