PORTLAND, Ore. -- Portland's  Zach Randolph  spiced up yet another double-double with something a bit unusual, at least for him. He dunked.
 Elias Says Roy Brandon Roy scored a game-high 26 points in Portland's win against Golden State. It's the fifth time this season that Roy has scored 25 or more points in a game, the most for a Trail Blazers' rookie since Kelvin Ransey did it 10 times in the 1980-81 season. 
 Read more  Elias Says . Randolph has only dunked a handful of times this season. He had 25 points and 13 rebounds in a 106-87 victory over the Warriors on Sunday night. It was his 34th double-double of the season. "That was kind of crazy," laughed teammate  Jarrett Jack  about Randolph's dunk, which came late in the first half. The Trail Blazers led by as many as 23 points over Golden State, which was unexpectedly without top scorer  Baron Davis . Davis didn't play because of stiffness in his surgically repaired left knee. Without him, the Warriors had their three-game winning streak snapped. Before Davis' return last Monday, the Warriors had lost six straight. "It's hard to believe one guy could have this much affect on a team, but that looked to be the case," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "He wanted to play late in the game but we weren't playing well and I didn't think we had a chance to win the game so I decided to wait another." Nelson said he found out about five minutes before the game that Davis wasn't going to be able to play. After Davis' recent return, the Warriors were finally coming together, notably in the backcourt.  Jason Richardson  has been back for 11 games after missing 22 with a broken hand. Davis had 25 points and seven rebounds to lead the Warriors to a 99-89 victory over the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Friday. He was averaging 20.7 points and 8.5 rebounds. "My knee was stiff and sore," Davis said. "It was hurting and that was about it." The Blazers had lost two straight, including a 99-94 loss to San Antonio last Tuesday. The long break apparently helped the Blazers. "The last couple of days in practice, guys looked a little fresher going up and down the floor," Jack said. Golden State was led by  Al Harrington , who had 16 points and seven rebounds. Richardson had 14 points. "We weren't really focused and Portland is a good team," Richardson said. "They are young but they play hard. When you have your main guy out, other guys have to step up. I'm not sure we had that." Portland went up 36-27 after  Martell Webster 's 3-pointer and  Travis Outlaw 's dunk off a pass from  Sergio Rodriguez . Rodriguez also found  Fred Jones , who made a one-handed dunk to make it 40-29. Portland led 52-45 at the half, but the Warriors quickly closed the gap to open the second half. Richardson's layup narrowed it to 52-50. That was as close as the Warriors would get. Leading 64-59, the Blazers went on a 14-0 run, capped by  Ime Udoka 's 3-pointer, to make it 78-59. During the run, Warriors guard  Stephen Jackson  was ejected. Unhappy with a call, he snapped the ball at the feet of an official. The loss ended a seven-game Golden State winning streak against the Blazers, including three straight victories at the Rose Garden. Rookie  Brandon Roy  added 26 points for the Trail Blazers. "I thought we got some breaks," Blazers coach Nate McMillan said. "For example, Baron Davis not playing helped us. He's always had good games against us." Game notes  Davis had 17 points and nine assists to lead Golden State to a 102-89 home win over Portland on Nov. 3. Davis was not listed as out for the game, but it became clear when he appeared on the bench in a suit after the first half. ...  Jeremy Richardson , a rookie out of Delta State who signed a 10-day contract with the Blazers, made a brief appearance late in the game.
