 Parker finished with 15 points and 10 assists to help the Spurs win for seventh time in eight games and rebound from a 100-98 home loss Tuesday night to Milwaukee. "I was just trying to make sure it got a chance," Parker said. "A chance, you know, with enough air on it. I knew there was not a lot of seconds left. It was just a good shot." Parker had to hoist his shot high in the air to avoid a block from the 76ers'  Andre Miller . The officials took another look at the replay to make sure the shot left Parker's hand in time. It was about the only thing Miller was unable to accomplish. He led Philadelphia with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting.  Andre Iguodala  added 25 points on 10-of-15 shooting as both teams shot more than 50 percent. "We fought back both offensively and defensively," Miller said. "We just couldn't finish it off." Tim Duncan  led San Antonio with 26 points on 11-of-15 shooting. Miller scored 16 points in the third quarter. His free throw with less than a minute remaining gave Philadelphia its first lead, 79-78. Roger Mason  made two free throws and hit a 3-pointer to give the Spurs a 96-91 lead with 8:10 to go, and it was tied at 104 with 1:15 left when Miller hit a reverse layup.  Manu Ginobili  made a layup to put the Spurs ahead 106-104, and Iguodala tied it with a dunk with 51 seconds remaining. Ginobili added 21 points in his reserve role. Mason scored 19 points on 5-of-5 3-point shooting.  Michael Finley  had 14 points, going 4-of-6 from 3-point land. Parker missed an 18-footer after Iguodala's dunk, but the Spurs got the ball back and set up the winning shot without using as timeout when Ginobili stole Miller's pass with 15 seconds left. It was Miller's only turnover of the game. Ginobili dribbled past half court and looked to Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who motioned to keep playing. "Sometimes it's better odds if the defense is not set," Ginobili said. "We didn't want to consume all the clock." It's a good thing for the Spurs that he didn't. His 3-pointer hit the rim and bounced over to Parker, who had just enough time to get off the final shot. "Tony got a great rebound and an unbelievable fade away from that corner," Ginobili said. "I was right in line with him, and it looked good as soon as he let it fly. So we got lucky again." The Spurs opened with a 40-19 first-quarter lead by matching a franchise record with eight 3-pointers in the first quarter. The best 3-point shooting team in the NBA, the Spurs finished 15-of-26 from 3-point range -- just one make shy of their franchise record. They were ahead by 16 at halftime. But the 76ers cut it to 74-66 on Miller's 3-point basket 4:47 into the second half. Miller drove past Ginobili to make it 78-74 with less than 3 minutes left in the quarter. Parker had a layup try blocked by  Theo Ratliff  and the 76ers came back down the floor and got another layup by Miller. He hit a 21-footer the next trip down and would quickly add two free throws for the 79-78 lead. "This is a heartbreaking loss after a great comeback by us," 76ers coach Tony DiLeo said. "There are not many teams that could come into this arena and be down by 21 and have a tie game with the Spurs and have a chance to win it."
