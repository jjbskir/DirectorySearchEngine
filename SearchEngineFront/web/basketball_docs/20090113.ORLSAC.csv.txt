SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Even the guys at the end of the bench were making 3-pointers on a record-setting night for the  Orlando Magic . Seldom-used  Jeremy Richardson 's lone basket proved the most memorable Tuesday night, a 3-pointer with 2:20 left in the fourth quarter that gave the Magic an NBA-record 23 3s in a 139-107 victory over the  Sacramento Kings . The Magic made 23 of 37 attempts (62 percent) in breaking the old mark of 21, set by Toronto on March 13, 2005, against Philadelphia. Orlando rang up its highest point total since scoring 152 at Milwaukee on Feb. 20, 1995.

 "I knew it was close to a record, but I really didn't know, I just took the shot," Richardson said in a jovial Orlando locker room. "It was a great record for the team, I was just happy to play and be a part of it." The Magic proved unstoppable from the perimeter in part because  Dwight Howard  was so dominant inside. Despite spending the entire fourth quarter on the bench, Howard had 25 points and 15 rebounds in helping Orlando win its fifth straight game and improve to an NBA-best 15-5 on the road. Jameer Nelson  made all five 3-point attempts and had 23 points and 11 assists,  Rashard Lewis  scored 19 points,  Hedo Turkoglu  contributed 17 points and eight assists, and  J.J. Redick  added 15 points. "No disrespect to the other team, but we're excited about getting the record, an NBA record," Nelson said. "Everyone is going to have trouble guarding the 3 against us because Dwight is so tough to stop in the middle." Kevin Martin  scored 30 points for the Kings, who allowed a season-high point total.  Francisco Garcia  scored 15 points,  Spencer Hawes  had 14 and  Bobby Jackson  added 13. "It's going to be a tough time sleeping tonight, but tomorrow we have to put this behind us," Garcia said. "That's the price you pay. We weren't playing any defense." That was evident from the start. Showing no letdown coming off a big road win Sunday in San Antonio, the Magic shot 62 percent in the opening half, when they never cooled off during an impressive offensive showing that resulted in a 75-56 lead. Orlando had the listless Kings defense to thank as well. Open shots were everywhere in the half, when the Magic went a staggering 13-of-19 from 3-point range in establishing new franchise records for 3-pointers and total points in a half. "We won't come out like that again," Martin said. "It's time to make people accountable because that was just embarrassing to me. We are a joke right now, that's how people look at us. They just keep launching 3s away. You should be pretty angry about that." The 3-point barrage continued in the third quarter. Nelson connected on a pair in the first 80 seconds and the Magic made seven overall in hiking their lead to 107-85 heading into the fourth. It felt a little like old times to Turkoglu, who broke into the NBA as a reserve when the Kings were putting up big offensive numbers and regularly posting lopsided wins from 2001 to 2003. "It actually did feel [like one of those Kings games]," Turkoglu said. "But I'm with the Magic now and we're playing really well. We felt really hot tonight and we broke the record." Orlando improved to 16-4 this season against the Western Conference. The Magic continue a four-game road trip Friday against the Lakers and meet Denver on Saturday. The loss was the 12th in 14 games for the Kings, who have not strung together two straight victories since early November. The Kings had no answer in the opening half for the athletic Howard, whose most impressive feat was an alley-oop dunk with his back to the basket. He scored 15 points and had 11 rebounds against an array of Sacramento defenders. Lewis and Redick both had 12 points for Orlando, which outscored the Kings 41-29 in the opening half. Game notes  Redick connected on four 3-pointers in the first half and two fans in the lower level repeatedly stood and chanted his name after each basket. The Kings are now 7-13 at Arco Arena and are on pace to have their worst home record in franchise history.  Kenny Thomas  made a rare appearance for the Kings, playing his fifth game this season and going scoreless in three minutes.
