MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The  Milwaukee Bucks  didn't seem to miss their coach very much Tuesday night. Actually, they didn't miss much of anything. Even  Desmond Mason 's unorthodox jump hook shots were falling on a scalding shooting night for the Bucks, who shot 60.3 percent from the field in a runaway 112-85 victory over the  Toronto Raptors . Mason finished 10-for-10 and had 21 points. "I got fouled on two of them and still made them," said Mason, who returned to Milwaukee as a free agent in the offseason. "Those were some lucky ones." The Bucks' offensive outburst came despite the absence of coach Larry Krystkowiak, who went to the hospital after his wife, Jan, went into labor with twins Tuesday afternoon. Krystkowiak, in his first full year as the Bucks' head coach after replacing Terry Stotts in the middle of last season, was there for the birth of healthy twin daughters at 7:42 p.m. By then, the Bucks had the game under control. "He got twins and a 30-point win," Bucks guard  Mo Williams  said. "What else can you ask for?" Bucks assistant Tony Brown coached the team in Krystkowiak's absence, presiding over a steady stream of scoring that started early and never really let up. On defense, the Bucks held Toronto star  Chris Bosh  to one point and the Raptors' starting five to a total of 28. Bosh, who nursed a nagging left knee injury through the preseason, wasn't willing to chalk his struggles up to conditioning. "I am healthy enough to play basketball," Bosh said. "If I'm on the court, there is no excuse. I just have to keep playing." A team official offered Bosh a stat sheet after the game, but Bosh said he didn't need it. Raptors coach Sam Mitchell wasn't willing to nitpick Bosh's play. "I am not going to talk about an individual guy," Mitchell said. "It was a whole team effort, not just one guy." Juan Dixon  led the Raptors with 20 points on a night that, combined with an overtime loss to Boston on Sunday, added up to a significant letdown from their 106-69 victory over New Jersey last Friday. "I told our guys we proved two things: We're good enough to win by 30, but we're also good enough to lose by 30," Mitchell said. "We have got to come out ready to play. Hopefully it was just one of those nights." For a while, it looked like the Bucks were going to have their best shooting night in more than two decades. Milwaukee was shooting over 65 percent with 5 minutes left in the game, but got sloppy at the end. Milwaukee hasn't shot 65 percent or higher for a game since a victory over Sacramento on Dec. 15, 1985. With Bosh limited to 10 minutes in the first half after committing two early fouls, the Bucks took their first double-figure lead with a 14-0 run late in the first quarter. Milwaukee led 59-39 after a three-point play by  Andrew Bogut  with 2:36 left in the second quarter. Toronto then went on a 9-2 run to close within 13, but Williams hit a jumper at the horn to give the Bucks a 63-48 lead. Milwaukee shot 67.5 from the field in the first half, including 76.2 percent in the first quarter. Bosh's only point came on a free throw with 5:22 left in the second quarter. He playing sparingly in the second half. Milwaukee went on a 17-3 run in the third quarter that included six points by Bucks rookie  Yi Jianlian  and was capped by Mason's 10th straight field goal attempt without a miss. Mitchell wished his team's defense had made life a little harder on Mason, but admitted that some of the shots were spectacular. "Some of the shots he hit -- the fadeaway, one-handed jump shot, hook shot -- you have got to give him credit," Mitchell said. Michael Redd  added 17 points for the Bucks, while Williams scored 13, Yi and Bogut both had 12 and  Bobby Simmons  added 11. Bogut had 11 rebounds.
