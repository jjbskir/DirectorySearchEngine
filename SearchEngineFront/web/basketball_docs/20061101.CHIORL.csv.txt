ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) --  Orlando Magic  coach Brian Hill thought his
team had no chance against the Bulls Wednesday night after watching
Chicago rout the defending champion  Miami Heat  to open the season. "They just drove the ball everywhere they wanted to go," Hill
said. Hill was happy to be wrong. Dwight Howard  had 27 points and 11 rebounds and  Jameer Nelson 
scored 21 points as the Magic surprised the  Chicago Bulls  109-94
Wednesday night in Orlando's season opener. The Bulls beat the Heat by 42 points the night before, but
couldn't find their stroke Wednesday. Howard took control, grabbing
lobs in the low post on fronting defenders and running the baseline
for backdoor dunks. "Dwight's going to be one of those guys in this league that are
going to make it hard, make it tough for anyone who comes into this
building to get a win," Bulls center  Ben Wallace  said of the
third-year player. Ben Gordon  flashed a dazzling array of reverse layups, drives
and fadeaway jumpers on his way to 24 points that kept Chicago in
the game -- barely.  Kirk Hinrich  had 14 points and four assists and
 Luol Deng  scored 12 for the Bulls. Grant Hill  had 19 points on 5-of-7 shooting and  Hedo Turkoglu 
had 11 points, seven rebounds and six assists. "This is obviously a real good way for us to start the season
against what I think is an excellent basketball team," Brian Hill
said. Orlando trailed only once -- by a point -- in the game's opening
minute. They won despite committing 23 turnovers to Chicago's 15,
outshooting the Bulls 59 percent to 45 percent from the field. Nelson keyed a 13-2 Magic run in the third quarter with a
jumper, layup and 3-pointer, scoring seven points on consecutive
trips in 1:17. The spurt gave Orlando an 80-55 lead before Malik
Allen turned in a three-point play with 4:31 left in the quarter. The Magic used a 17-6 second-quarter run over four minutes to
take a 63-45 lead at halftime. Six different players scored in the
span, including an alley-oop dunk and three-point play from Howard. "Their length bothered us," Bulls coach Scott Skiles said.
"They got in some passing lanes early. We weren't able to complete
passes, so we just sort of dribbled around and shot the ball." Hinrich drew a technical with 1:50 left in third quarter
reacting to his fifth foul. He picked it up defending Keyon
Dooling's baseline drive less than a minute after being whistled
for his fourth. He played limited minutes in the final quarter but
never fouled out.
