OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The New Orleans Hornets held a promotion
Monday night to encourage their fans to vote for  Chris Paul  as an
All-Star starter, even having Paul take the microphone at the Ford
Center before the game to ask for support. His performance against the  Cleveland Cavaliers  proved a more
eloquent argument than anything Paul, or anyone else, might say.
Last season's NBA Rookie of the Year scored 30 points and added 11
assists and the Hornets overcame recent offensive woes to beat the
Cavaliers 95-89. "Chris Paul gave us 30 reasons" why he should be considered as
an All-Star, Hornets coach Byron Scott said. "That is pretty good. I have been saying this all along, that
he is one of the best point guards in this league. There is no
doubt about it, and this is just his second year," Scott said.
"He is the main reason that we are .500 right now with all of the
guys we have missing. ...He is carrying the load right now, and
that is tough." After starting the season 8-3, the Hornets -- who are without
three of their top six players because of injuries -- had lost seven
of their last eight games and had scored 80 points or fewer in four
of those losses. But they shot a season-best 54.7 percent from the field -- only
the second time this season they've exceeded 50 percent -- and took
advantage of a 4 -minute fourth-quarter scoreless stretch by the
Cavaliers. Cleveland led for much of the first three quarters and was up
73-72 entering the fourth before the teams swapped the lead nine
times in a 3 -minute stretch. The Cavaliers didn't score from the 9:08 mark until 4:24
remained, misfiring on six straight possessions and allowing New
Orleans to build a 7-point lead. Two 3-pointers by rookie Daniel
Gibson helped Cleveland tie the score at 89-89 with 2:36 left. Cleveland had a chance to take the lead, but the Hornets' Tyson
Chandler blocked a driving shot by  LeBron James , and Paul scored at
the other end with 1:45 left to put New Orleans ahead for good.
After a Cleveland miss,  Jannero Pargo  added a runner in the lane at
1:02 and Paul made two insurance free throws with 19.2 seconds
left. The Cavaliers missed three 3-point shots in the final minute. "We have got to figure out the next time we play these guys how
to stop a guy like Chris Paul from creating like he did tonight for
his teammates," Cleveland coach Mike Brown said. James, hounded on defense for much of the game by the Hornets'
 Desmond Mason , finished with 15 points on 7-of-18 shooting -- well
below his season average of 27.3 points per game -- and did not
score in the fourth quarter, missing all four of his shots. James had averaged 35.7 points in his last three games against
the Hornets. "They made me pass the ball so I just needed to find the open
man," James said. "You just have to take what the defense gives
you. I'm not going to force it." Scott was more effusive in his praise of Mason. "As soon as the game was over I told him (Mason) that he did an
unbelievable job," Scott said. "It is hard to keep a great player
like that from scoring in the fourth quarter, especially as much as
he is going to have the ball." Cleveland, led by 17 points from  Anderson Varejao , fell to 4-2
this season against Western Conference teams. They had won seven
straight games against the Hornets, dating to Dec. 23, 2003. Cleveland led for most of the first half and took their largest
lead to that point on a 3-pointer by Gibson that made it 48-41. The
Hornets closed the half on a 10-3 run and tied the game at 51-51 on
a jumper by Paul with 31 seconds left. The pattern continued in the third quarter. The Hornets led for
40 seconds before Cleveland jumped back ahead. The Cavaliers'
largest lead came with 4:45 left, when a drive and basket by James
made it 69-62. Paul almost singlehandedly kept New Orleans close with 11
third-quarter points, including a buzzer-beating 20-footer. Pargo came off the bench to score 15 points for the Hornets, and
 Marc Jackson  added 14 points.  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  added 15 points
for Cleveland. < 
^NOTES:@ Hornets owner George Shinn reaffirmed before the game his
plans to return the team full-time to New Orleans next season,
saying it was "the right thing to do." ... During his pre-game
speech, Paul also encouraged Hornets fans to vote for three of his
teammates on the All-Star ballot --  Peja Stojakovic ,  David West  and
Chandler. ... The Hornets announced the attendance as 19,164, the
fifth sell-out of the season for the team and the fourth in
Oklahoma City, although small pockets of empty seats were visible
in the arena. ... West (right forearm strain), Stojakovic (back
spasms) and  Bobby Jackson  (cracked rib) didn't play for the
Hornets, while  Drew Gooden  (strained left groin) was out for
Cleveland and is listed as day-to-day.
