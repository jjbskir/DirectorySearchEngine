TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto's best players were out with injuries. It didn't seem to bother the Raptors. Charlotte's best players couldn't shoot straight. It proved costly to the Bobcats. Kris Humphries  and  Carlos Delfino  both scored 17 points,  Joey Graham  added 13 and the Raptors shrugged off injuries to three top players to hand the Bobcats their sixth straight loss, 98-79 on Monday night. Toronto played without forwards  Chris Bosh  (strained groin) and  Andrea Bargnani  (hyper-extended left knee) and guard  T.J. Ford  (left thumb). It didn't matter to the Raptors, who got 12 points and nine assists from  Jose Calderon  and double-digit scoring from five others to post their fourth straight home win. "The guys who needed to step up, stepped up," Raptors coach Sam Mitchell said. "The guys who played, played well. The defense was good. We did the things we wanted to do." The same could not be said of the Bobcats, who failed to overcome poor shooting performances by  Raymond Felton  (0-for-8),  Jason Richardson  (3-for-17) and  Gerald Wallace  (4-for-13). "When that group is 7-for-38, then we don't have a chance," Charlotte coach Sam Vincent said. "Our core players, who have to provide us with some scoring punch, just couldn't get it going. We don't have the depth for two or three of our core guys to not perform." The Bobcats missed nine of their first 11 field goal attempts and were 12-for-43 (28 percent) in the opening half. "I just had a bad game tonight," said Richardson, who was 0-for-6 in the first half. "Being one of the top guys on the team, I've got to show up every night, but nights like that are going to happen sometimes where you can't make a shot." Wallace scored 19 points and rookie  Jared Dudley  had 16 points and 10 rebounds for Charlotte, which has lost the six straight after a 6-4 start, the best in the team's four-year history. Depth was no problem for Toronto, who buried Charlotte by shooting 11-for-20 in the first quarter. The Raptors led 16-4 midway through the first after Graham, making his first start of the season, threw down a one-handed dunk. Delfino's 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded to end the first gave Toronto a 27-16 lead. Charlotte has not led after the first quarter in any game during its current losing streak. "We're digging ourselves into the Grand Canyon right now and it's too much to come back," Wallace said. The Raptors began the second quarter with a 10-3 run and a tip-in by Humphries gave Toronto a 54-33 halftime lead. Toronto is 2-1 in the three games it has played without Bosh, who leads the team with 18.8 points and 7.9 rebounds. Calderon said Toronto pulled together with its top trio on the bench. "Without Andrea, without Chris and T.J., everybody plays together," Calderon said. "Today, Kris Humphries and Joey Graham had a good game. We need everybody to win games." Richardson and  Matt Carroll  both scored 12 points for the Bobcats and  Emeka Okafor  had 10. Anthony Parker  had 11 points for Toronto and  Jason Kapono  scored 10. Charlotte's only sign of life was a 9-0 run to start the second half, as consecutive 3-pointers by Richardson and another by Wallace cut the gap to 55-42. Graham ended Toronto's drought with two free throws at 9:40 and the Raptors scored seven of the next eight points to push the lead back to 62-43 with 7:40 left. Vincent tried to change his team's fortunes by putting Dudley into the starting lineup in place of center  Primoz Brezec . "He was a bright spot in what was just a miserable evening," Vincent said of Dudley. The Raptors have won nine of the 11 meetings between the teams, including the past four.
