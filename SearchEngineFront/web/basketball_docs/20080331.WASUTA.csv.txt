SALT LAKE CITY (AP) --  C.J. Miles  was the only Utah starter still playing at the end of a blowout against the  Washington Wizards . With the game Miles was having, coach Jerry Sloan would have had a hard time getting him out of there, anyway. First-Half Wonders The Hawks and Jazz each parlayed 73-point first halves to victories on Monday. For the Nuggets, 70 points in the first half wasn't enough to get it done. Team Points FG pct. Result 
 Hawks 73 69.4 W, 116-99 
 Jazz 73 67.4 W, 129-87 
 Nuggets 70 60.4 L, 132-117 
 Miles scored a career high 29 points, making four 3-pointers as the Jazz set a record from beyond-the-arc in a 129-87 win over the weary Wizards on Monday night. "I never want to come out of the game. I don't think anybody does, especially when you're making shots," said Miles, who was 12-for-17. Miles wasn't alone in making shots. Every Jazz player who put up a shot made one and Utah atoned for a 110-103 loss at Minnesota the day before by running over the exhausted Wizards, who went to overtime in a loss to the Lakers on Sunday night. Washington was also wrapping up a five-game Western Conference road trip and played without  Caron Butler , who rested his strained left hamstring one day after getting his third career triple-double. The Wizards may have been better off just flying straight to Washington instead of making a brief but miserable stop in Utah. The Jazz outrebounded Washington 40-23, had 40 assists on 50 field goals and shot almost 60 percent (50-for-84). "Hopefully, we can learn from what they do and how they play," Washington coach Eddie Jordan said. "We just didn't have it. When we tried to take away the paint, they made shots. They got the juice going." Deron Williams  had 12 points and 16 assists, despite resting most of the fourth quarter, and  Mehmet Okur  returned from a stomach virus with 16 points, nine rebounds and five assists.  Carlos Boozer  added 19 points and  Kyle Korver  scored 15, making all six of his shots. The Wizards were wrapping up a five-game Western Conference road trip and coming off a 126-120 overtime loss to the Lakers the night before. They were also resting Butler's strained left hamstring instead of playing him back-to-back nights. Antawn Jamison  led Washington with 22 points. Miles had never scored more than 20 and was starting for  Andrei Kirilenko , who missed his second straight game with a calf injury.  Ronnie Brewer  also sat out with a groin injury and  Ronnie Price  got the start, adding 10 points as every Utah starter scored in double figures. The Jazz led by 47 at one point and Sloan rested his starters for almost all of the fourth quarter. But he didn't have anybody to replace Miles, who just turned 21 two weeks ago and was happy to get some extra playing time. Miles hit Utah's 14th 3-pointer to tie the team record, then rookie  Morris Almond  broke it on another with 6:06 left in the game. "That was a pretty fun game," Williams said. "We had a couple guys out still, but pretty much like all season at home we had guys come in and step up. C.J. played a great game." The Jazz improved to 33-4 at home, where they can't afford to lose down the stretch after struggling badly on the road. Utah lost Sunday at Minnesota 110-103. The Jazz still lead the Northwest Division, but Denver is within range if the Jazz falter down the stretch. There was no chance of that Monday. The Jazz pulled away late in the first quarter, then blew the game open in the second. Utah outscored Washington 42-19 in the period, tying the team record with seven 3-pointers and going 16-for-24 from the field. "They attacked us [and] kept attacking," Washington's  DeShawn Stevenson  said. "Everybody on their team played well." The Jazz opened the second on 19-4 run, scoring 17 straight at one point, and continuing to pull away from there. Korver and Okur hit 3-pointers early in the run and Washington called time out after Okur's put the Jazz up 46-24 with 7:36 left in the second. The Wizards didn't score after  Roger Mason 's 21-footer with 11:24 left in the second until  Nick Young  drove for a layup with 6:46 left, which only cut the lead to 48-26. Brendan Haywood  got Washington within 50-29 on a three-point play with 6:10 left in the period, but the 21-point margin was as close as the Wizards would get. Miles hit a 3-pointer with 31 seconds before halftime and after a miss by Washington, Williams hit another 3 for the Jazz with 3 seconds left to give Utah a 73-41 lead. Mason scored 16 and Young added 18 points off the bench for the Wizards. Game notes  Referee Dick Bavetta officiated his 2,300th consecutive game. ...
