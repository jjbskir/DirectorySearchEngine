OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --  Baron Davis  treated his grandmother to a
good show with the help of his former college teammate  Matt Barnes . Davis had 21 points and 16 assists to lead the Golden State
Warriors to their fourth straight home victory, 116-97 over the
 Philadelphia 76ers  on Tuesday night. Barnes tied a franchise record
with seven 3-pointers and scored 25 points. Davis, raised by his grandmother Lela Nicholson in Los Angeles,
played in front of her for just the second time in Oakland. Davis made sure to acknowledge his grandmother during halftime,
visiting her at her courtside seat. "Baron is a great point guard and with him here and me being
close to home, I feel comfortable," said Barnes, who hails from
Sacramento. "This is the right time and the right place. I'm
getting the opportunity to play." After two nondescript years with the 76ers, Barnes reworked his
shooting form and has become a fan favorite with Golden State. He's
set career highs in points (32) and rebounds (12) with the
Warriors, and reached double figures 10 times with a pair of
double-doubles. Barnes entered the year with career averages of 3.7
points and 3.0 rebounds. "You could tell he was focused from the first couple of 3s,"
Davis said. "Matt wanted to prove to them that he can shoot it.
It's great to have guys like him out there, finishing plays." Rodney Carney  scored a career-high 25 points for the 76ers, who
continue to have problems on the road. Philadelphia lost its 11th
in 12 away contests and is 3-12 on the road.  Andre Iguodala  and
 Andre Miller  each added 14 points. "Golden State is a unique team," the Sixers'  Kyle Korver  said.
"With Barnes playing the four and hitting all those 3s, there
aren't many teams who play like that. We were never in the flow
offensively or defensively. This was not a good night." Andris Biedrins  had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Warriors
and  Ike Diogu  scored 13.  Mickael Pietrus , who wore a facemask to
protect his broken nose, had 17 points. The Warriors led by as many as 29 points during the second half
and held their largest halftime lead of the season at 67-47. The Sixers fell to 2-2 since trading  Allen Iverson  to the Denver
Nuggets a week ago for Miller,  Joe Smith  and two first-round picks
in 2007. Barnes hit his first three 3-pointers of the second half and
scored nine of the Warriors' first 11 points, forcing the Sixers to
use a pair of timeouts in the first 4:30 of the third quarter.
Golden State led 91-62 with 3:22 left before settling for a 93-71
edge entering the final quarter. "He's got something to prove," Iguodala said. "His game spoke
for everything. He's been with us twice and he wanted to show us
that we didn't treat him right or something. He had a chip on his
shoulder." Davis exploited nearly every opportunity to pile up 11 assists
and 14 points in the first half. The Warriors shot 67 percent in
the second quarter (12-of-18), finishing off plays created by the
veteran point guard. "We had a lot of open 3s and it's my philosophy that if a
3-point shot is created by a teammate then you have to take that
shot," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "The guys spaced out the
floor extremely well, allowing us to only have to run a few
plays." Chris Webber  sat out the second quarter for the Sixers, a period
in which Philadelphia managed to make just eight of 22 shots. The
Sixers missed all three 3-point attempts. Barnes and Pietrus combined to make five of seven 3-point tries
in the first half. The Warriors made nine of their first 13 shots and went on an
11-0 run to open an early lead, extending their advantage to as
many as 14 points. The 36 points were their second-highest total at
home in the first quarter. Game notes Warriors G  Monta Ellis  has his right arm in a sling to
