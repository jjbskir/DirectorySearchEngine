ATLANTA --  Jason Terry  remembers those dreadful home games at Philips Arena, where the Hawks often seem like visitors in their own building. "I can recall vividly, like it was yesterday, that the other team was used to winning," he said. "That's all I can tell you about that." Terry scored 15 of his 27 in the fourth quarter to help Dallas beat the  Atlanta Hawks  104-97 on Sunday for the Mavericks' sixth straight win. Dirk Nowitzki  and  Josh Howard  each scored 28 points for the Mavericks, who improved the NBA's best record to 58-11. "We're pretty good when we're healthy but we're not where we need to be," Dallas coach  Avery Johnson  said. "We aren't anywhere close where I need them to be. If we had to start the playoffs tomorrow, I would really be concerned, but again, we've got some time." Now in his third season with the Mavericks after playing his first five with Atlanta, Terry hit two 3s, a 12-footer and a pair of free throws in the final 3:54. Dallas' biggest lead came at the 5:16 mark of the second quarter, when Howard's turnaround jumper made it 51-28. After Terry's 14-footer gave Dallas a 73-63 lead with 2:52 left in the third, the Mavericks scored just one field goal over their next 12 possessions, a stretch that included five turnovers. "We had some sloppy issues there, and they dominated us at the free-throw line," said Johnson, whose team improved to 33-3 when scoring at least 100 points. "They shot 49 free throws, and guess what? They deserved every one of them. We were out of position. I actually told the refs twice, 'Good call,' because it's stuff that we've been teaching." Josh Childress ' dunk gave Atlanta its only lead at 79-77, but Terry, drafted 10th overall by the Hawks in 1999, answered 22 seconds later with a straightaway jumper. Following a pair of free throws by Howard with 7:44 remaining, Dallas never trailed again. Terry was still mad at himself for trying to force the pass to Nowitzki that  Josh Smith  stole and passed up the court for Childress' dunk. "I was trying to force the ball where there wasn't an opening," Terry said. "So I took it upon myself to be more aggressive, look for my shot. Atlanta has lost three straight, five of six and 13 of its last 19 games. Childress and Josh Smith each scored 21 for the Hawks.  Marvin Williams  cut the lead to 86-84 with 5:26 remaining before Nowitzki answered with a straightaway 3-pointer. "They beat you in so many different ways," Childress said. "I think their pace offensively makes them very hard to guard. They're moving around and when you get to rotating, a guy hits a wide-open 3 or a guy is slipping to the bucket. Their offense is kind of centered around the elbows. It's hard to guard the elbow." Dallas' 39-point first quarter was the most prolific opening period this season for an Atlanta opponent. "We didn't give up," Smith said. "We played well for three quarters. The first quarter kind of hurt us. We put ourselves in position to win the game, and when we messed up on a couple of switches at the end, it kind of cost us the game."
