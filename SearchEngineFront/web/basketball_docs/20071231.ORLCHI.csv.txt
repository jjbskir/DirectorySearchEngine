CHICAGO (AP) --  Hedo Turkoglu  made plenty of bad decisions on Monday, but it still didn't scare Stan Van Gundy enough to take the ball from his hands at the end of the game. Turkoglu hit a fadeaway jumper with seven-tenths of a second left in overtime, and the  Orlando Magic  beat the  Chicago Bulls  112-110. Magic Man The Magic were 18-14 at this time last season. They're 22-11 this year, and the improvement can be attributed to Dwight Howard picking up his game across the board. Here are his stats through this time of the year both seasons:  2006-07 2007-08 
 Points per game 16.9 23.1 
 Rebounds per game 12.5 15.3 
 Blocks per game 1.9 2.7 
 
After Chicago's  Ben Gordon  hit a tying 3 with 6.7 seconds left, Turkoglu made a shot over  Ben Wallace . The Magic's fourth win a row was secure when Wallace missed from midcourt at the buzzer. Turkoglu, who missed a shot in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter, finished with 17 points after making numerous turnovers that had Van Gundy scratching his head. "Struggled? Oh my gosh. The guy has been great but today -- forget the shooting, anybody is going to have a day like that -- but some of those passes. We actually had point shaving allegations in our locker room after the game," Van Gundy said jokingly after the game. "I put the ball in his hands because I have a great confidence in his ability to play off the dribble and make solid decisions. The solid decision part was not there today. But then again, he comes right back through in the end and hits the big one." Dwight Howard  had 17 points and 22 rebounds for Orlando. He also blocked five shots and made three steals, including a key swipe from Gordon late in the fourth quarter to improve the Magic's remarkable road record to 15-5. "Dwight was tremendous. I do think that I've got to find some different ways to get him the ball. We're not getting it to him enough right now," Van Gundy said. "But the thing I've liked the last couple of games is that he hasn't let that affect his performance. I thought he was huge defensively tonight, had a huge steal late in a trap on Ben Gordon, rebounded everything." Gordon led Chicago with a season-high 39 points and  Luol Deng  added 19.  Kirk Hinrich  finished with 10 points and 10 assists before fouling out in the fourth quarter. The Magic trailed 107-106 in overtime, but  Jameer Nelson  beat  Chris Duhon  for an easy layup with 26.9 seconds left.  Keith Bogans  made two free throws to put Orlando ahead 110-107. Nelson scored 22 points and  Rashard Lewis  had 19.  Carlos Arroyo  and Bogans each had 14 for the Magic. "It feels great. Unbelievable," Nelson said. "It's a great opportunity to get on a roll again. We have a great team and we just want to continue to play hard and get better every day." Orlando trailed 96-93 with 1:08 left in the fourth quarter before Nelson made one of two foul shots. Howard then stole the ball from Gordon, leading to two free throws by Nelson that made it 96-all with 36.5 seconds left. After Gordon missed a shot with 13 seconds remaining, the Magic had a chance to win in regulation. Turkoglu missed in the lane and Howard also missed with a tip at the buzzer. The Bulls led 55-48 at halftime behind Gordon's 15 points. Howard recorded his NBA-high 29th double-double by the break with 10 points and 13 rebounds. The Bulls lost for the first time in three games since Jim Boylan became interim head coach following the firing of Scott Skiles. The players have appreciated his laid back attitude. "He doesn't get too high or too low," Gordon said. "That works when guys see Jim being so calm. He leads us in kind of a relaxed way." His first move was to have Gordon come off the bench, and it has been working. Since the move Gordon has scored 31 and 25 points in his two previous games. "The last two games, I feel like I found my shot," Gordon said. Game notes  Nelson came off the bench after missing Sunday's game against the Bobcats with a strained back.
