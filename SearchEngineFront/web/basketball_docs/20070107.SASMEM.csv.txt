MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- No  Tony Parker , no sweat,  Tim Duncan  said
with a straight face. Parker missed his first game of the season with a right hip
strain, but  Manu Ginobili  scored a season-high 34 points, and the
 San Antonio Spurs  beat the  Memphis Grizzlies  110-96 Sunday. Elias Says Ginobili  Manu Ginobili scored 34 points in the Spurs' 110-96 win at Memphis. It was Ginobili's third consecutive game scoring 25 or more points, the longest such streak by a Spurs guard since 1986, when Alvin Robertson posted a three-game streak.

season. "It had a big difference. We won the game," Duncan said in a
deadpan tone about Parker's absence. "I think that says something.
We need to trade [Parker] or get rid of him or something." Ginobili, who averaged 25.5 points in the previous two games,
was 10-of-15 from the field, including 6-of-8 from 3-point range.
His career-best six 3-pointers were among San Antonio's season-high
14 baskets from behind the arc. "I only knew about Tony just before the game," Ginobili said.
"I don't think I had so many more touches (with Parker out), I
just happened to make every shot." Robert Horry  had 18 points, also a season high,  Michael Finley 
added 12, and Duncan and  Bruce Bowen  had 10 apiece. Pau Gasol  led Memphis with 24 points, and  Mike Miller , who left
the game briefly in the third quarter because of a jammed right
thumb, finished with 14.  Damon Stoudamire  added 13 points, and
 Alexander Johnson  had 10. San Antonio scored the first two baskets of the fourth period to
build an 18-point lead, and Memphis never got the deficit under
double digits as the Spurs won their sixth straight over the
Grizzlies. It marked the first time under interim coach Tony Barone
that Memphis has not scored 100 points in its new running style. "(We) held them to 24 points under what they've been
averaging," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "With as many
possessions as there were in the game, I thought that was a pretty
good (defensive) effort on our part." As Boston did on Friday night, the Spurs put special emphasis on
making sure Miller didn't get open looks at the 3-point line.
Bowen, relieved at times by Ginobili, stayed on the Memphis
shooter, chasing him down the floor on breaks and fighting over
picks to challenge most shots, keeping Miller out of a rhythm.
Miller finished 5-of-13 from the field. "He commands that kind of respect defensively by the way he
plays," Bowen said. "He's a shooter, and it's obvious he's got
talent and can hurt you." It was part of the Spurs' strategy to force Memphis to be more
deliberate on offense. Grizzlies reserve point guard  Chucky Atkins 
said San Antonio doubled him on breaks to get the ball out of his
hands or used one of its frontline players to stop penetration. "I think a lot of times we're playing at such a high pace that
when things aren't necessarily there, we're not disciplined enough
to stay with it and execute it," Atkins said. "We're rushing
shots, and we're not getting the best possible shots. "(The Spurs) kind of throw you off your rhythm offensively.
That's all you really need to do. It's not about blocking shots or
getting steals. If they can throw you off your rhythm offensively,
they can make you miss shots." Despite Parker's absence and Duncan missing four of his first
five shots, the Spurs still managed to build an 11-point lead
midway through the second, and Ginobili's 3-pointer in the closing
seconds helped give San Antonio a 57-45 lead at the break. Memphis led only once in the game, by two in the early stages,
and trailed by as many as 18. "When they were open, they made all their open jump shots. They
made us pay when we helped and we missed a lot of foul shots,"
Johnson said of Memphis' 4-of-10 free throw performance in the
first half. "We just didn't come ready to play. They threw the
first punch, and it just tumbled on from there." Game notes Beno Udrih , the third-year guard out of Slovenia, started
in Parker's place. Parker, who sat on the bench in street clothes,
had started all 34 of the Spurs' games this season prior to Sunday.
