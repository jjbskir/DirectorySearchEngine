MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- At the end, the  Portland Trail Blazers  depended on  Travis Outlaw  to end a long, bad stretch of road. Outlaw scored 21 points, including the winning 6-foot runner as the buzzer sounded, to give the Trail Blazers their first road victory of the season, 106-105 over the  Memphis Grizzlies  on Monday night. "I was hoping to get fouled, but they didn't call anything," Outlaw said of the game winner. "Then, it went in anyway, and I was like 'Oh!'" Officials reviewed the basket not only to see if Outlaw got the shot off in time, but also whether the clock started properly when Portland inbounded the ball with 2.8 seconds left. Outlaw took the inbounds pass near midcourt and drove the right side on  Mike Miller  before firing the off-balance bank shot. Outlaw scored the last seven points for the Trail Blazers over the game's final 56 seconds. "I saw that there was less than a second left or whatever out of the corner of my eye just when I shot it," Outlaw said. It was Outlaw's second buzzer-beater of the game as his 30-footer at the horn cut Memphis' lead to 80-78 at the end of three quarters. Rudy Gay  had 30 points, including a sweeping rebound tip with 2.8 seconds left to give Memphis the lead before Outlaw's winning basket. Miller had a season-high 30 points for the Grizzlies, who had a foul to give at the end, but didn't take advantage. "We talked about it," Miller said. "You never know how it's going to end. In hindsight, it looks like the play to make." Brandon Roy  had 26 points for Portland, which had lost its first nine road games this season.  LaMarcus Aldridge  finished with 23 points. Juan Carlos Navarro  had 16 points for Memphis, while  Pau Gasol  added 14 points and 15 rebounds. The game was tied at 99 with 2:08 left after Roy hit an 18-footer. But consecutive baskets by  Damon Stoudamire  gave Memphis a 103-99 lead with just over a minute to play. Outlaw bounced in a 9-footer with 56 seconds left and added a 3-pointer with 15 seconds remaining to give Portland the lead before Gay's sweeping tip-in. Outlaw was 8-of-13 from the field and connected on all three of his shots outside the arc. "[Outlaw] made just three extremely hard shots," Gasol said. "One of them bounced around and got in. The 3-pointer from the corner was wide open, but he still had to make it. Then that floater when the time was almost done. It was a very tough loss." Outlaw, from Starkville, Miss., about two hours southeast of Memphis, had more than a dozen family members at the game. He ran over to hug his father after the shot, the first game-winner the fifth-year player could recall since being drafted out of Starkville High School as the 23rd overall pick in 2003. The Grizzlies led 57-50 at halftime behind 18 points from Miller and 14 from Gay, as they combined to shoot 12-of-19 in the half. James Jones  had 11 of his season-high 16 points in the first half to lead Portland. Memphis came out flat in the early minutes of the second half committing four turnovers in the first three minutes and missing its first three shots. "We had a chance to lead by 13 or 15 and establish, but we didn't do that because of our transition defense," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "We came out very slow at the half, and all of a sudden, we're in a game. It was a little out of control." For the Trail Blazers it took every second of their 10th road game to finally win away from the Rose Garden. And Roy said it will take a similar effort if Portland is to play better away from home. "We played with the same intensity that we've been playing with at home," he said, adding: "We're a young team and we have to play together. We can't have two guys playing well and win on the road. We have to have six or seven guys play well and that's what we had [Monday night]." Game notes  Portland had not scored more than 80 points in three of the last four games. ... Neither Grizzlies G  Mike Conley  nor Trail Blazers C  Greg Oden , teammates at Ohio State last season, played. Oden, the first overall pick, wasn't with the team after preseason right knee surgery, and Conley, the fourth pick, is still recovering from a right shoulder injury. ... The Trail Blazers were wrapping up a three-game road trip. ... Grizzlies C  Darko Milicic , who was playing only his second game after missing seven games with a sprained left thumb, left the game midway through the first quarter favoring his left ankle. The injury was classified as a sprain. He did not return, but X-rays were negative. ... The win marked the first time this season Portland has won when allowing an opponent 100 points. ... Roy, last season's rookie of the year, was averaging 9.4 points over his last five games, including only four points on 1-of-9 shooting in Portland's loss to San Antonio on Sunday.
