MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) --  Stromile Swift  proved he can be very effective when he's active on offense. Swift scored a season-high 24 points,  Mike Miller  added 19 points and seven assists and the  Memphis Grizzlies  beat the  Seattle SuperSonics  125-108 on Monday night. "I just tried to move without the ball," said Swift, who was 10-of-14 from the field. "They were focused on  Pau [Gasol]  mostly, and I was able to get open and get easy baskets. That helped me out a lot." Damon Stoudamire  had 16 points and seven assists, and  Hakim Warrick  added 16 for the Grizzlies, who stopped a three-game skid. Gasol had 14 points, seven rebounds, five assists and seven blocks, one short of his career-high for rejections. "Pau was good. Stro was really good. They ran the floor," Miller said. "[Warrick] did a good job of feeling spots. So when our big guys play like that, we're pretty good." Delonte West  led Seattle with 17 points,  Chris Wilcox  added 16, and  Jeff Green  had 11 points and 14 rebounds. "We're not coming out as strong as we should," said Seattle rookie  Kevin Durant , who had 11 points, but was 2-of-8 from the field with five turnovers. "We're digging ourselves a hole and deciding to play hard when we're already down double digits." With Memphis center  Darko Milicic  out with a bad left thumb, Swift started at center, allowing  Rudy Gay  to play small forward. Part of the reason for the switch was to keep Gay, who has struggled with foul problems, from guarding Wilcox, Seattle's bulky forward. "We just felt Stro's defensive presence on Wilcox was important," Memphis coach Marc Iavaroni said. "Wilcox really is a guy they can rely on for interior scoring. It turned out to be a good decision. [Swift] was active. He ran like he's capable of running." Seattle was able to chip away at the lead, and even got it under 10 in the latter stages of the second quarter, despite foul trouble that sent big men Wilcox,  Johan Petro  and  Nick Collison  to the bench with three fouls each. "It was because the guys they were guarding were pretty good," Seattle coach P.J. Carlesimo said. "Once again, we were getting beat pretty good on penetration, so we were in a lot of help situations, and a lot of reach-in situations."
