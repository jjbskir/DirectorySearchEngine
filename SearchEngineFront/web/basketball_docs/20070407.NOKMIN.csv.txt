MINNEAPOLIS -- With five games left and New Orleans 2 1/2 games out of the final playoff spot in the West,  Chris Paul  wasn't about to let a sore left foot sideline him again. "He gave me that look last night that said, 'I'm playing tomorrow," Hornets coach Byron Scott said. Paul scored 18 points and had 10 assists in his return, and  Rasual Butler  added 17 to help the Hornets beat the  Minnesota Timberwolves  96-94 on Saturday night. Paul scored 10 straight points during a crucial back-and-forth stretch in the third quarter after missing the previous night's loss to Phoenix because of the foot injury. "Chris is a little fire cracker,"  Marc Jackson  said. "For him to be out there with six or seven games left in the season trying to help us get to the playoffs, that means a lot." Jackson added 15 points and 11 rebounds starting in place of injured  Tyson Chandler  (left big toe).  David West  also had 15 points for the Hornets, who trail the L.A. Clippers for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference. The Hornets also got plenty of help from the sinking Wolves, who had a season-high 14 3-pointers but went 11-for-38 from the floor in the second half. New Orleans also went 28 of 38 from the free-throw line while Minnesota was 10-for-14. "They're not going to foul too many jump shooters," Wolves coach Randy Wittman said. Rashad McCants  led Minnesota with 17 points and  Mike James  had 15, but they combined for only seven in the second half.  Kevin Garnett  scored five of his 13 points in the final minute, including a 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds to play to make it 95-94. Paul followed with a free throw and  Craig Smith 's shot from just inside halfcourt hit off the side of the rim at the buzzer. "The second half, we got diverted like we always do," Garnett said. "Same ol' Same ol." Paul had enough quickness to frustrate the Wolves. "I just took control of the game and started being more aggressive," Paul said. "Coming off screens, they were sort of leaving me open." He had an unbelievable 3-point play in the third quarter during his 10-point spurt. With Garnett and  Ricky Davis  intentionally fouling him on a break, Paul threw up an off-balance shot that banked in. The free throw gave the Hornets a 68-67 lead. "Funny, but it didn't start feeling well until the fourth quarter," Paul said of his foot. New Orleans closed the quarter with a 12-8 run. Both teams shot terribly in the fourth quarter. New Orleans was 4-for-21 while Minnesota went 5-for-20. The Wolves pulled to 86-85 on Davis' 3-pointer with 3:14 to play, but Butler answered with a 3 at 2:07 and West added a 17-footer with 38.8 seconds left. The Wolves scored a season-high 36 second-quarter points -- rookie  Randy Foye  and McCants each had 12 -- en route to a 64.9-percent first-half shooting performance. Game notes  Garnett barely extended his double-digit scoring streak to 397 games. He was stuck at eight points until a jumper with 18.2 seconds left. I wasn't really in no real groove," Garnett said. "Stroke-wise, I just didn't have it like I usually do." ... The Hornets had 28 offensive rebounds to Minnesota's four. ... With 12 points on Friday night against New York, Garnett raised his career point total to 19,011. That makes him just one of five players in NBA history to amass at least 19,000 points, 10,000 rebounds (10,520) and 4,000 assists (4,136) in his career. Others on the list include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,  Karl Malone , Wilt Chamberlain and Charles Barkley. "He plays the right way and it shows when you mention numbers like that," Wittman said. ... West has made 30 of his past 31 free-throw attempts.
