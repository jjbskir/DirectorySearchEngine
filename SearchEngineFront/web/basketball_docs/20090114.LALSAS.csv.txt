 Roger Mason  hit a jumper with 10 seconds left and made a free throw after being fouled by  Derek Fisher , and the Spurs beat the Lakers 112-111 on Wednesday night in the first meeting between the teams since the Western Conference finals. After Mason's three-point play, the Lakers failed to get a shot off and  Trevor Ariza  was called for traveling with 0.8 seconds left. The Lakers rallied from 11 points down in the fourth quarter, taking a two-point lead when  Kobe Bryant  hit a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left. The Spurs called timeout and worked the ball over the Mason in the corner, where he was bumped from behind by Fisher while shooting from about 16 feet. "I saw him try to reach for the ball," Mason said. "I wanted to get a little contact and then get the shot off. When I fell down, I looked up and saw it go in. "I just didn't want to ruin it. I knew we needed that point."

 Mason, signed by the Spurs as a free agent after playing in Washington, finished with 18 points, going 3-of-4 from 3-point range and 7-of-11 overall. On Christmas, he hit a last-second 3-pointer to beat Phoenix on the road. "He has the confidence to do it, and he has the license to do it," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "We all trust him." The late foul spoiled the game for Fisher, who was 4-of-4 from 3-point territory and scored 16 points. "Hopefully, next time we're back, it won't be that way," Fisher said. "It'll be the other way around." "It was too close to our bench to see what happened," Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. "I thought Mason received the ball and there was a collision. I don't know whether he created the collision or Fisher did." Manu Ginobili  led San Antonio with 27 points, and Bryant had 29 for Los Angeles. He added 10 assists. Both teams are 10-2 in their last 12 games. Bryant was double-teamed on the Lakers' last play, so he swung the ball to Ariza. But Ariza was called for traveling. "He got tripped," Bryant said. "They're not going to make that call. So what? It was just a wild game."
