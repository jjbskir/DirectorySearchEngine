 "It was just winning time," Wade said after the Heat's 100-96 victory over the  Charlotte Bobcats . Yep, he was just about unstoppable again. Wade scored 41 points, 10 in the final 8  minutes to lead the Heat back from a seven-point deficit for their fourth straight win -- extending Miami's longest streak since the 2006-07 season. "He took over the game," Charlotte's  Jason Richardson  said. He's been doing that with regularity so far this season. Adding to his NBA-best scoring average, Wade was 12-for-22 from the floor, 15-for-19 from the line, and added eight rebounds for good measure as the now-requisite cries of "M-V-P" serenaded him from the stands. He even found  Shawn Marion  for the basket with 1:01 left that put Miami ahead to stay and gave the Heat just their second win in the last eight meetings with Charlotte. "This team never goes away, kind of like us," Wade said. "They're young, youthful and athletic. We knew it was going to be a battle. We just had to stop them on the defensive end." Mario Chalmers  scored 15 points and Marion finished with 13 for Miami. Richardson scored 24 for Charlotte, but missed two free throws that would have tied the game with 32.3 seconds remaining. Okafor added 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Bobcats, who were without their second-leading-scorer  Gerald Wallace , who was in Alabama to mourn the death of his grandmother. "Anything could have happened had I made those free throws," Richardson said. Without Wallace, the Charlotte bench did its part to pick up the slack. D.J. Augustin  scored 14 points and  Adam Morrison  added 13, including a long 3-pointer from the left wing with 6.7 seconds left that drew the Bobcats to 98-96. But Wade sealed his night -- and the win -- with two free throws a half-second later. "What I was really encouraged by was the end of the game," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "We did a lot of things technically not right ... but at the very, very end, I felt we won that game defensively." Charlotte missed six straight shots in the latter stages, including one trip where  Yakhouba Diawara  simply smothered Richardson and forced him into a bad miss as the shot clock expired. "We played well enough to win," Charlotte coach Larry Brown said. "We missed a layup, some free throws, tough things happened. But Wade was great. He's playing at such a high level." It was Wade's seventh game of at least 35 points already this season -- most in the league. He also got the benefit of a late whistle, raising Charlotte's ire:  Jared Dudley  was called for a block with 1:30 remaining against Wade, who made both free throws to put Miami up 90-88. Augustin hit a 3-pointer with 1:11 to play that gave Charlotte a 91-90 lead, but Wade coolly brought the ball down on the ensuing possession, looked over a soft double-team to find an open Marion, and the Heat never trailed again. "Hey, I was just cutting and he found me," Marion said. "I'm really good at moving without the ball, it was just a breakdown in their defense and we got a bucket out of it." Charlotte had just three turnovers -- which Miami turned into exactly zero points -- in the first half, a major reason why, even though Wade had piled up 22 points at the midway point, the Heat went into the locker room leading only 51-48. Wade got his scoring total up to 31 after the third quarter. Problem was, his teammates only contributed six points in the period, combining to shoot 3-for-11, and the Bobcats led 68-66 entering the fourth. They extended the margin to seven, but left Wade just enough time to take over. "He's a superstar," Augustin said. Game notes  Rappers Lil' Wayne and Bow Wow sat courtside, and University of Miami standout Jack McClinton -- a good friend of injured Heat forward  Dorell Wright  -- also was in attendance. ... Heat center  Jamaal Magloire  needed seven stitches to repair a cut right elbow in the first half, after he took a tumble while fighting for a rebound. ... Bobcats reserve  Alexis Ajinca  scratched his right cornea in the first half, after scoring four points in his only 2 minutes of playing time.
