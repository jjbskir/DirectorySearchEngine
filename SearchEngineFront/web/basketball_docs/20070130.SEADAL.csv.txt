 Dallas is two wins shy of the franchise record for consecutive home wins, set last season. Croshere, who began the night averaging 2.9 points per game, played 24 minutes as a reserve in Howard's absence after scoring in double figures only twice in his first 21 games this season. Acquired in an offseason trade with the  Indiana Pacers , Croshere went 11-for-14 from the field, including 7-of-10 from 3-point range, and finished tied for 12th in franchise history for bench points. "With Josh not here, I had a chance to get in early," Croshere said. "I was just trying to stay ready for the opportunity to play. I got the chance and I played well." Jason Terry 's 19 points,  Greg Buckner 's season-best 17 and  Devin Harris ' 16 helped the Mavericks set a season high for points and beat the Sonics for the ninth straight time. Ray Allen  had 35 points, 19 in the first half, for Seattle, which tied a single-season club record with its 13th consecutive road defeat.  Nick Collison  and  Earl Watson  both had 15 points for the Sonics.

 Croshere  Austin Croshere was the unlikely hero in Dallas' win over Seattle, scoring a career-high 34 points. Croshere entered the game averaging 2.9 points per game (in 25 games) this season. Since 1980, only one other NBA player scored 30 or more points in a game, while previously averaging fewer than three points per game in that season. The Bulls' Jannero Pargo scored 34 points against Milwaukee on March 26, 2004; he averaged 2.4 points per game in 20 prior games that season.

 Croshere, who set a career-high for 3-pointers, had his previous career-high of 32 points for the Pacers in a game against the Mavericks on Feb. 5, 2002. Howard is Dallas' second-leading scorer (19.4 points per game) and third-leading rebounder (7.2). Minus Howard, the Mavericks needed more minutes from Croshere, who didn't see any action the previous four games. Croshere had a total of 15 points in the first four games he played in January. Croshere can't wait to meet and thank Howard's child for the playing time. "I'm going to give the kid high-five," Croshere said with a laugh. Nowitzki, who started the night averaging 25.3 points and 9.6 rebounds, finished with 15 points and six rebounds. Nowitzki was 3-for-12 from the field. But Dallas got a season-high 63 points off the bench led by Croshere and Buckner. "It was a great night for Cro," Dallas'  Jerry Stackhouse  said. "Everybody's been pulling for him. He's been very supportive of us. Josh was out and Dirk didn't have a great game, but it didn't matter. Cro was our MVP tonight." Croshere capped a 13-4 run spanning the late third and early fourth quarters with a three-point play and a 3-pointer on consecutive possessions to give Dallas a 91-82 lead with 10:37 left. Croshere added another 3 with 7:54 left to stretch the Mavericks' lead 100-88. Dallas took a 66-54 halftime lead with its highest scoring half this season. The Mavericks shot 58 percent from the field in the first half and had four double-figure scorers led by Terry's 13. Seattle rallied to tie twice in the third quarter before fading down the stretch. "We really pressed them," Sonics coach Bob Hill said. "It was a five-point game but we couldn't sustain it in the fourth quarter." Hill said he wasn't surprised at Croshere's big game. "He's capable of doing what he did," Hill said. "That's how their team is made up. He's paid to do that." Game notes  Terry will have his No. 31 retired on Friday night by Seattle's Franklin High School. Terry, who led Franklin to consecutive Washington state championships in 1994-95, will fly to Seattle for the ceremonies, then rejoin the Mavericks for Saturday night's home game against Minnesota. ... Howard is expected to rejoin the team on Wednesday. ...Croshere had the second biggest points-to-minutes ratio in club history. Mark Aguirre had 36 points in 23 minutes for the Mavericks against the  Denver Nuggets  in 1987. ... Rashard Lewis  missed his 18th consecutive game for Seattle due to a right hand injury. ... Mavericks rookie J.J. Berea scored 40-plus points twice last week during a stint with the Fort Worth Flyers of the Developmental League. ...The Sonics hit their first six field goal attempts and were tied at 28 entering the second quarter.
