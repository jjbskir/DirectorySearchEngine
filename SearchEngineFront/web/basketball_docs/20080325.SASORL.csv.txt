ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The  San Antonio Spurs  refused to let the  Orlando Magic  beat them with long-distance shots. "We made a decision to make them penetrate," Ginobili said. "We were not going to let  Rashard [Lewis] ,  Hedo [Turkoglu]  and  Keith [Bogans]  take wide-open shots." The strategy worked.  Manu Ginobili  scored 28 points and  Michael Finley  added 24 as the Spurs beat the Magic 107-97 on Tuesday night for their fourth straight win. Dwight Howard  had 24 points and 21 rebounds, his eighth game this season with at least 20 in both categories, but it wasn't enough for Orlando.  Rashard Lewis  added 24,  Keyon Dooling  19 and  Carlos Arroyo  17. "We missed some opportunities, missed some layups, turned the ball over on fast breaks," Lewis said. "We played good defense, but we couldn't convert running out." Turkoglu didn't have too many chances. He left in the second quarter with a sprained right wrist, and fellow starter  Jameer Nelson  got knocked out of the game with a bruised jaw after apparently running into Howard. Tim Duncan  had 19 points and 15 rebounds for San Antonio, Finley scored 24 points and  Tony Parker  and  Bruce Bowen  each added 11 points. Parker also had nine assists. Orlando led 69-61 in the third quarter, its largest margin of the game, before a 6-minute scoring drought. It started after  Keith Bogans  missed all three free throws following a foul while shooting a 3, and ended with the Spurs ahead 76-69, then their biggest lead. "We hit a little stretch in the third quarter where we couldn't score," Dooling said. "From that point on, they took control of the game. Orlando trailed 80-73 entering the fourth quarter, but drew to 87-85 on Lewis' 3. But the Magic scored only two points over the next 3 minutes -- also from Lewis -- as the Spurs pulled away. Ginobili scored 13 in the fourth quarter, half of a guard tandem that burned Orlando for at least 20 apiece in its second straight loss. The Spurs, the NBA's second-best team guarding the 3, held the Magic to 7-for-16 shooting behind the arc. Orlando had made at least 10 3-pointers in the past 10 games. "We kept them under their season average in points," Duncan said. "We know they have a lot of great shooters." Game notes  Second-year guard  J.J. Redick  played 9 minutes, getting rare first-half court time because of Orlando's injuries. He had two points on 0-of-5 shooting. ...  Brent Barry  wasn't active, a day after re-signing with the Spurs. ... Orlando is the only NBA team that has never won a season series against the Spurs. San Antonio won the earlier matchup this season 128-110.
