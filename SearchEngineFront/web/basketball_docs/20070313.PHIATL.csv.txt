ATLANTA --  Josh Smith  still finds it hard to believe that the  Atlanta Hawks  have won four straight without leading scorer  Joe Johnson . "That has to be big for our team and our confidence," Smith said. "We have to figure out a way to keep it up without him until he gets back."
 Elias Says Smith Josh Smith had 26 points, 17 rebounds and five assists in Atlanta's win over Philadelphia. Only two other players reached all three of those statistical levels in one game this season: Josh Howard (28, 17 and 5 against Denver on Dec. 31) and Kevin Garnett (27, 17 and 7 in an overtime game against San Antonio on Jan. 3). 
 Read more  Elias Says . Smith had 26 points and a career-high 17 rebounds in Atlanta's 104-92 victory over Philadelphia on Tuesday night, leading the Hawks to their fourth straight victory and ending the 76ers' seven-game winning streak. "I thought we came ready to play," Hawks coach Mike Woodson said. "Defensively, we rebounded the ball, and offensively, we were making shots. We were sharing the ball. That's huge for our team." Andre Iguodala  led the Sixers with 18 points.  Rodney Carney ,  Kyle Korver  and former local high school star  Louis Williams  combined for 31 points in reserve roles, but starters  Samuel Dalembert ,  Steven Hunter  and  Willie Green  had a total of just 15. Philadelphia's two top reserves, Korver and  Joe Smith , were hardly factors. Joe Smith went 0-of-5 from the field and was scoreless with six rebounds. Korver, who made his only 3-point attempt, entered with a 44.3 percent average beyond the arc to rank No. 6 in the NBA. "It came down to Atlanta beating us to a lot of those loose balls," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. "They were quicker than we were, and our defense was not sharp. They outrebounded us as well. I think Atlanta did a lot of things tonight that we had been doing right." Josh Smith, coming off a career-high 32 points in a win last Saturday against Minnesota, gave the Hawks their biggest lead at 79-50 on a layup. Josh Childress  and  Zaza Pachulia  each scored 15 for Atlanta.  Marvin Williams  finished with 14, and Smith pulled down eight of his 17 boards on offense. "I was trying to get easy points off the offensive rebounds," Smith said. "I was trying to get aggressive and get a couple of tip-ins." At 26-39 and with 17 games remaining, the Hawks matched their victory total of last season. Surprisingly, Atlanta hasn't lost since Johnson suffered a right leg contusion in a March 5 defeat at Miami. That loss was the Hawks' sixth straight, eighth in nine games and 11th in 15. "We win four games and it's like, 'Oh, was that the problem?' " Childress said. "I think we just caught a nice little stretch of games and our confidence ... we're just playing carefree. With the group it's more, 'Let's play and have fun.' And when you're having fun, playing carefree, your game goes up to another level." According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Philadelphia had become just the second team in NBA history to win seven straight after falling 20 or more games under .500. Golden State had an eight-game winning streak after a 23-45 start in 2004-05. "Our defense was very poor, and we gave up a lot of offensive rebounds," Korver said. "We didn't play very smart basketball, and that got us crushed on the boards. When you put those two things together, it doesn't matter who you play in the NBA, you're going to get beat."
