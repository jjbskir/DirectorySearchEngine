CHICAGO --  Ben Gordon  did his scoring in the first quarter, then watched the rookies take over from there. Gordon scored 16 of his 22 points in the first 12 minutes, rookie  Tyrus Thomas  tied a career high with 14 points, and the  Chicago Bulls  beat the  Golden State Warriors  113-83 on Wednesday night. Rookie  Thabo Sefolosha  scored a career-high 19 points and reserve  Adrian Griffin  added a season-high 17 for the Bulls, who bounced back after dropping consecutive games. Gordon was impressed with the performances of Thomas and Sefolosha. "They are starting to play a lot better. Obviously, they started off a little bit slower. Just the whole rookie process, but they are starting to play better now," Gordon said. "We need both of those guys big time down the stretch, so it's good to see them come around." Leading 62-58 at the half, the Bulls pushed the ball up the floor and opened the third quarter by outscoring the Warriors 20-6. Thomas started the second half after coming off the bench to begin the game. He had a steal and then Gordon rewarded him on the other end with a behind-the-back pass that Thomas finished with a dunk.  Kirk Hinrich  followed with a 3-pointer to put Chicago up 72-60. Later, Gordon's jumper gave Chicago a 82-64 lead with 5:55 left in the third quarter. Gordon and Thomas also hooked up earlier in the game on spectacular alley-oop dunk in the first quarter. It appeared the pass was a little too high for Thomas, but Thomas soared up and brought it down. Gordon never had any doubt about the pass. "I probably threw it too low for him. That guy is a high flyer," Gordon said. Chris Duhon 's 3 gave the Bulls a 95-69 lead at the end of the third quarter and Sefolosha finished a breakaway with a dunk to extend the lead to 103-71 with 8:54 left. The Warriors have lost four straight and 12 of their last 14 on the road. They are also 1-15 in second games of back-to-backs. "I definitely feel responsible for this," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "I thought I could get this team to the playoffs, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen. I feel that I failed in a lot of ways, really." Kelenna Azubuike  led the Warriors with 23 points and  Jason Richardson  scored 17 points and had six rebounds for Golden State, which has missed the playoffs the last 12 seasons. "It's really tough when your best player on the floor like tonight is a D-League player. Azubuike played 40 minutes and left everything out there," said Nelson. The Warriors played without forwards  Stephen Jackson  and  Josh Powell . Jackson was out with a fractured left big toe and Powell was held out for precautionary reasons after he was hurt when he dove for a loose ball late in the game against Milwaukee on Tuesday night. He slid head first into the scorer's table with about a minute left in the game. The Warriors only played with nine healthy players. Golden State is also missing guard  Baron Davis , who is recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery. "I don't want to say anything disparaging about Golden State, but it's hard to evaluate right after a game like that until you look at the tape," said Bulls coach Scott Skiles. The Warriors, who were finishing off a stretch where they played four games in five nights, stayed with the Bulls in the first half. They trailed 31-28 after one and were led by Richardson's 15 points. Azubuike and  Monta Ellis  each added 12 points. Gordon hit four 3s in the first quarter and scored 16 points. He finished the half with 18 and Sefolosha added 12 off the bench.  Luol Deng  finished with 13 points for Chicago. Game notes  Golden State lost its fifth consecutive road game. ... The Warriors are 6-23 on the road this season. ... Griffin was 5-for-6 on field goal attempts. ... Bulls forward  P.J. Brown  suffered a left knee contusion and did not return in the second half.
