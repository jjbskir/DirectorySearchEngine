PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- With the game on the line, Orlando coach
Brian Hill drew up the right play and  Grant Hill  executed it
perfectly. Grant Hill scored off the inbounds pass with 1.5 seconds left to
give the Magic a 91-89 victory over the  Portland Trail Blazers  on
Friday night. Dwight Howard  had 18 points and 16 rebounds and Hill scored 16
points for the Magic, who led nearly the whole game until a late
Portland comeback. The game was tied at 89 when Hill came off a screen from Jameer
Nelson, caught the pass from  Hedo Turkoglu  and scored. "That was pretty much Coach," Hill said. "He drew up an
awesome play. He told to come off the screen and go back door and I
was pretty much open." After that,  Travis Outlaw 's halfcourt shot at the buzzer missed. "This is a game we should have won," Blazers coach Nate
McMillan said. "But it comes down to listening and learning from
it." Zach Randolph  had 28 points and 13 rebounds and keyed Portland's
second-half comeback, but the Blazers fell for the ninth time in 11
games. Jarrett Jack  had 14 points and five assists for Portland. Outlaw
added 13 points and eight rebounds. The Magic led by nine points in the fourth quarter. Portland,
using a lineup that included reserves  Sergio Rodriguez , Outlaw and
 LaMarcus Aldridge , clawed back in it and tied it at 87 on two free
throws by Aldridge with 1:42 remaining. Outlaw scored with 1:09 left to give the Blazers their first
lead. Hill picked off Rodriguez at midcourt and made two free
throws to tie the game. Portland tried to hold for the last shot,
but 20-year-old rookie Rodriguez missed a runner, leaving the door
open for Hill's game-winner. Trevor Ariza ,  Darko Milicic  and  Keyon Dooling  all had 10 points
off the bench for Orlando, which has won six straight, including
the first four games on its six-game road trip. "Those are the types of games you have to win," Nelson said.
"When you go into other buildings, they have the fans and some
momentum. You have to play well." Aldridge had 10 points and five rebounds for the Blazers. Orlando led 26-19 before Jack beat the first-quarter buzzer with
a 3-pointer. The Magic led 51-42 after two free throws by Hill and
were up by seven at the half. The third quarter belonged to Randolph, who had 16 points in the
quarter and scored to get the Blazers within two. Dooling converted
a three-point play to make it 72-67 at the end of the third. Jack outplayed Nelson, who came in averaging 14.4 points but was
limited to one point and five assists. He was 0-of-4 from the
field. Jack, a second-year pro from Georgia Tech, was coming off a
career-high 21-point game against Indiana, when he held Jamaal
Tinsley in check. The banged-up Blazers got some good news on the injury front.
Power forward  Raef LaFrentz  plans to return from a heel injury for
Tuesday's game at Detroit and rookie  Brandon Roy  (heel) took off
the protective boot he's been wearing after an MRI on Friday. The
Blazers, however, won't bring Roy on their upcoming six-game road
trip, and don't expect him to practice until Dec. 16. Game notes Brian Hill and Howard were named Eastern Conference coach
and player of them month, respectively, on Friday. ... The Magic
won at the Rose Garden for just the second time in eight trips.
Orlando is 4-12 against Portland all-time.
