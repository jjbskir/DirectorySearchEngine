 Friedell: Good And Bad

 Rose made it look easy despite a bruised right hip, hitting his first nine shots and scoring 29 points to lead the  Chicago Bulls  to a 118-85 victory over the  New York Knicks  on Tuesday. "A bruise is going to heal each day, so it's nothing that I should worry about," he said. "Tomorrow, it should feel even better than today." Rose was certainly feeling it against the Knicks. Achy after getting knocked to the court on a foul by Orlando's  Dwight Howard  last week, he shook it off with a dominant performance as the Bulls matched their most lopsided win of the season and handed the Knicks their fourth straight loss and 13th in 17 games. An early layup triggered some pain. It didn't stop Rose, though. Rose buried all seven shots while scoring 15 in the first quarter and was 14 for 18 in all, just missing his sixth 30-point game. "You couldn't really tell,"  Luol Deng  said. "His jumper was falling today. He didn't attack as much. He didn't really need to." He had help from Deng, who added 18 points.  Kirk Hinrich  scored 14, and Chicago shot a season-high 60.5 percent. David Lee  led New York with 24 points and 12 rebounds, but the Knicks were simply overmatched by Rose and the Bulls. They shot 34.6 percent, were blocked nine times and were dominated on the boards 49-38 in the first of back-to-back games with Chicago. "They just overwhelmed us physically," coach Mike D'Antoni said. Both teams could have a different look by the end of the week, with the trade deadline approaching. For the Knicks, that might not be a bad thing, considering they've dropped 13 of 17. The Bulls weren't exactly lighting it up either, dropping four of six before the All-Star break, but they did just that this time. Particularly Rose. After taking the big hit from Howard, the All-Star guard was the one connecting on Tuesday. He mixed in floaters, drives and jumpers in the early going, yet despite his dominant start, the Bulls were up just 29-28 through the first quarter. They finally started to pull away late in the second, outscoring the Knicks 15-6 over the final four minutes to take a 64-50 lead into halftime. Brad Miller  started that run with a neat drop stop and Rose buried a baseline jumper, making him 9 for 9 and extending the lead to 53-44. He finally missed when he pulled up for a jumper with just over two minutes left, but Hinrich added a 3-pointer. Deng hit a layup and Rose converted a finger roll off a nice crossover to make it 60-48 with 40 seconds left, before New York's  Jared Jeffries  ended the half with two free throws. Any thoughts of a comeback quickly vanished as Rose led the Bulls on an 8-0 run to open the second half. After Hinrich started it with a pull-up jumper, Rose buried a 21-footer and added a 17-footer after a put-back by  Taj Gibson  to make it 72-50. "When he's hitting that jump shot, he's especially tough to handle," Lee said. "He's so strong. When he starts going to the basket, he's so good finishing. He's one of the best finishers as far as guards are concerned in the league." Game notes  The teams meet again Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. ...
