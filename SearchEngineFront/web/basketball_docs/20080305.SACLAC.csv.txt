LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Coming off a 30-point loss to Detroit and a 26-point defeat against Philadelphia, the  Los Angeles Clippers  found themselves down by 17 against Sacramento and appeared headed toward another embarrassing night on their home court. Somehow, they managed to rally in the second half and snapped a six-game losing streak Wednesday night with a 116-109 double-overtime victory that kept the undermanned Kings winless against Pacific Division teams. Al Thornton  scored 13 of his 27 points after regulation,  Corey Maggette  added 22 and  Dan Dickau  scored a season-high 20.  Chris Kaman  had 17 points and 11 rebounds in 36 minutes after averaging 23 points and 16.5 boards in the Clippers' previous two games against Sacramento. Third-year forward  Josh Powell , who came in averaging just 14.7 minutes for Los Angeles, played a career-high 51 minutes, with 10 points and 11 rebounds. "We kept plugging away. That's the sign of a good competitive team," reserve point guard Dan Dickau said. "We're out of the playoff race, but for us to salvage something from this season we need to continue to play hard and play together." Beno Udrih  scored 25 points and  Mikki Moore  had 20 for the Kings, who have lost six of their last seven.  Ron Artest  sat out because of a sore right foot and shooting guard  Kevin Martin  was sidelined with a bruised right thumb. Sacramento has dropped five of its last seven against the Clippers after winning each of the previous 14 meetings. The Kings are 0-9 this season against division rivals -- the only team in the league that hasn't beaten a club from its own division. The Clippers never trailed in the second overtime. Dickau, who missed a potential winning 3-pointer in the final second of the first OT, got the Clippers going in the second extra period with a 3-point basket and they ended the game with a 10-4 run. "This is why I come into the gym early every day to take some extra shots," Dickau said. "There have been some times this year when I have not been making shots when I have a good look. But I think Mike [Dunleavy] has the confidence in me to still pull the trigger. Tonight I hit a few big shots, and it felt good." The Clippers' previous double-overtime contest was April 9, 2005, when they lost 125-124 at home against San Antonio. This was Sacramento's second double-OT game this season. The other was a 123-118 win over the  New York Knicks  at ARCO Arena.  John Salmons , who started in Martin's spot, played a career-high 52 1/2 minutes while scoring 13 points on 4-for-14 shooting. "It was a long game," Kings coach Reggie Theus said. "We had it in our hands a couple of times and just let it go. We had several opportunities to finish the game." The Kings led 60-43 on Moore's 19-footer with 9:33 left in the third quarter. They started the fourth with an eight-point advantage before the Clippers closed to 81-79 on a pair of free throws by Kaman, a layup by Thornton and two more free throws by Maggette. Sacramento extended the margin to 89-82 on a 20-footer by Udrih with 2:26 left in the fourth period. But the Clippers went on a 9-2 spurt, tying it on a 3-pointer by Dickau and a 15-footer by Thornton with 18.6 seconds on the clock to force OT. "We had a good lead at halftime and they just kept chipping away at it," Sacramento's  Spencer Hawes  said. The longer the games go on the road -- overtime, double overtime -- it definitely benefits the home team." Game notes  Kings coach Reggie Theus, who played against Kevin Johnson for four seasons in the NBA, was pleased to hear Johnson would run for mayor of Sacramento. The municipal election will be held in June. Johnson, who was born in Sacramento and played his high school ball there, moved back to the city in 2000 and formed "St. HOPE," a nonprofit community development corporation. "He can have my vote. We have to always support each other when it comes to stuff like that," Theus said. "He's always been about the community and about kids." ... Clippers F  Tim Thomas  missed his third straight contest because of a groin strain.
