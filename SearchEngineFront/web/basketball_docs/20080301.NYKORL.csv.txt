ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Short at guard, the  Orlando Magic  turned to two unlikely sources to run the offense. Both responded brilliantly. Hedo Turkoglu  just missed a triple-double with 25 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds and  Carlos Arroyo  had 13 points, eight assists and only one turnover as the Orlando Magic beat the  New York Knicks  118-92 on Saturday night.

The Knicks' loss was their 41st of this season assuring them their seventh straight season without a winning record.  That streak is one shy of the longest in franchise history.  New York had a .500-or-worse record in eight consecutive seasons from 1959-60 through 1966-67.

 Dwight Howard  dominated inside with 26 points and 22 rebounds with the Knicks missing leading rebounder  Zach Randolph . "I don't want to get too excited," said Turkoglu, the small forward. "It's just one night, until the other guys come back." Orlando was without injured guards  Jameer Nelson  and  Keyon Dooling , and used only eight players until the last 4:50. All five starters scored in double figures.  Rashard Lewis  had 22 points and seven rebounds and  Maurice Evans  scored 11. It was Howard's NBA-leading 52nd double-double, and seventh game of the season with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds. Jamal Crawford  had 23 points and seven assists, and  Quentin Richardson  added 16 points and seven rebounds for the Knicks. Crawford had 17 points in the first 15 minutes as New York opened the game 16-of-25 from the field. The Knicks led by as many as five in the second quarter before the Magic pulled away with a 13-0 run. Howard had six in the spurt and Lewis capped it with a 3-pointer that put Orlando ahead 62-49. "Before you knew it, a five-point game had turned into a 14-point game," Isiah Thomas said of an early Knicks lead that quickly evaporated. The Knicks were short-handed also, because Randolph was a late scratch. He took a few shots in pregame warmups, then went to the locker room with a sore right foot. He said someone stepped on it in New York's Friday night loss at Atlanta. "The way the inactive list needs to be reported now, when Zach came back in and said he couldn't play we had already filled out the form," Thomas said. Dooling (sprained left foot) and Nelson (strained hamstring, flu) were both hurt in the Magic's loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday, but Nelson's bigger problem was illness. Without either, Van Gundy was forced to use Arroyo, who before Wednesday hadn't played in six previous games. Arroyo was Orlando's starter for a stretch a few months ago, but hadn't played double-digit minutes since Feb. 4. "I still did my normal cardio and lifting weights and I was staying ready," Arroyo said. "It's been like this all season for the guards." Knicks reserves  David Lee  and  Malik Rose  scored 11 each. Orlando made good on almost all 10 Knicks turnovers for 18 points, while New York scored 10 on 12 Orlando turnovers. Game notes  The Magic are 3-0 against the Knicks this season. ...
