 Beaubois went 9 for 14 from the field and 3 for 6 on 3-pointers in 24-plus minutes, stepping up in the absence of the team's No. 2 scorer,  Jason Terry . "We really wanted to win this one because of [Terry] being out," said Beaubois, the 25th overall pick of the draft by the  Oklahoma City Thunder  before the native of Guadeloupe was traded to Dallas. "I really tried to be aggressive. We needed everyone to push themselves." Terry, who averages 17 points a game, is expected to miss 10-14 days following Friday's surgery to repair facial injuries sustained in Wednesday night's win over Minnesota. The team's confidence is Beaubois is growing. "Roddy did a great job for us being that energy plug that [Terry] usually is and hitting some big shots," Nowitzki said. Dallas has only two double-digit victories during the current streak, 10-point wins over Phoenix and Orlando. The rest have gone down to the wire. "When you're on a streak like this, everybody's gunning for you, everybody wants to be the team to take you down," said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who was ejected in the second quarter. "So you're going to get everybody's best game. We've had some slow starts, but it's something we've been able to overcome many times." Carl Landry  had 21 points, and  Beno Udrih  and  Tyreke Evans  each added 20 for the Kings, who'd won three of their previous four. After trailing by as many as 10 in the first half, Dallas closed the third quarter with a 9-1 run with the help of  Shawn Marion 's back-to-back baskets, building an 85-72 advantage heading into the final 12 minutes. The Kings got as close as 102-100 with 1:36 remaining on Evans' layup. Sacramento had a chance to draw even, but  Caron Butler  stole the ball from a driving Evans, leading to two free throws from Nowitzki with 51 seconds left. "We cut it to two and Tyreke drove to the basket, but he didn't get the call," Sacramento coach Paul Westphal said. "I'm not saying it was a foul, I'm saying he didn't get the call. [The Mavericks] did what veteran teams do, they put us away." Nowitzki and  Jason Kidd  each converted two foul shots over the final 21.5 seconds to seal the victory. Kidd had 17 points and 12 assists. Nowitzki has been successful on all 17 fourth-quarter free-throw attempts in the last two games. Carlisle was tossed by referee Bob Delaney after picking up two quick technicals while protesting a no-call on a drive by Nowitzki. Assistant coach Dwane Casey took over for Carlisle with Dallas trailing 43-33, and the Mavericks went on a 19-10 run over the remainder of the second quarter. Asked if he communicated with Casey during the game, Carlisle laughed and said, "No notes, no text messages. That would be illegal." Sacramento held a 53-52 halftime lead, despite Beaubois' 16-point second quarter. The Mavericks have won the last 12 meetings with the Kings in Texas, and have taken 13 of the last 15 matchups. "Out of 48 minutes, we had probably 43 or 44 that were good enough to win," Westphal said. "The biggest difference was that we turned it over 17 times [leading to 24 points for Dallas]."
