EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) --  Vince Carter  came off the bench to help the  New Jersey Nets  end their home-court disadvantage. Carter scored 24 points Saturday night in a reserve role, and the Nets ended a five-game home losing streak with a 94-92 overtime victory over the  Philadelphia 76ers . Jason Kidd  equaled his season high with 19 points for New Jersey.  Richard Jefferson  had 23 and  Antoine Wright  15 as the Nets overcame an 18-point first-half deficit. "Regardless how bad the first half had gone for us, we still felt we had opportunities and a lot of basketball left," Carter said. "We had to be a different team in the second half as far as our effort, execution and togetherness." Andre Iguodala  paced the 76ers with 24 points.  Kyle Korver  and  Andre Miller  each had 14 and  Louis Williams  13.  Samuel Dalembert  had six points and 16 rebounds. In the overtime, both teams had trouble scoring until they got to the foul line in the final minute. Iguodala made two free throws with 2.8 seconds remaining to cut the Nets' lead to 93-92. On the inbounds, Kidd lofted a long pass downcourt to Carter, who was immediately fouled by Iguodala. Carter made one free throw, leaving the 76ers a final desperation shot, a long-range heave by  Willie Green  that missed. The Nets made a lineup change, starting  Malik Allen  while bringing Carter off the bench. It worked, as Carter paced the Nets and Allen added six points. "They just wanted to go for a different look," Carter said. "It didn't matter. When I got out there, I just needed to give us something, to be a spark." Carter hit a turnaround fade-away jumper 41 seconds into the fourth quarter to put the Nets up 62-61, their first lead since the opening quarter. That set the stage for a tight final period. The 76ers edged ahead 73-68 on Korver's basket with 6:41 remaining. The Nets kept battling, pulling even at 77 when Kidd hit a 3-pointer with 2:27 left as time wound down on the shot clock. It was a struggle to the end of regulation. The Nets had a chance to win after Miller tied it at 83 by hitting two free throws. Carter had the final shot, a layup that bounced off the rim with 3 seconds remaining. The 76ers shot well in the first quarter, going 13-of-18 from the field to take a 28-19 lead. Iguodala led all scorers in the period with eight points. Philadelphia went on a 14-3 run in the second quarter to expand its advantage to 46-29, with Korver and Williams each sinking a 3-pointer. The 76ers ended the half with a 51-35 lead. Kidd hit a 3-pointer to spark a 10-3 run by New Jersey at the start of the third quarter. Kidd was the catalyst in the period with seven points, three rebounds and two assists as the Nets battled back to cut the deficit to 61-60 after three quarters. "To our guys' credit, they came out and played with more passion and intensity in the third quarter," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. New Jersey outscored Philadelphia 25-10 in the third quarter. "We knew they would come out in the third quarter," said 76ers coach Maurice Cheeks. "We couldn't score the ball. We just couldn't consistently score. I thought overall our defense was good, but it wasn't enough to keep us from going down." Game notes  Before the game, Frank explained the decision to bring Carter off the bench. "It's not a demotion," Frank said. "We won three games with him coming off the bench. We've been lacking points off the bench. Coming off the bench, he can be a little fresher, be more of a hub and a focal point and carry more of an offensive burden. It's a game-by-game deal." ... The Nets were the fresher team, having not played since a 110-103 home loss to Memphis on Tuesday. The 76ers played three times since Tuesday, including an 85-84 win over Washington at home on Friday night.
