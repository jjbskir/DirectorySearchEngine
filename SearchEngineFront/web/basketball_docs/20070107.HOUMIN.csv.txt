MINNEAPOLIS (AP) --  Mark Blount  is making it tougher for
Minnesota's opponents to focus on  Kevin Garnett . The 7-foot Blount continued his recent strong play with 21
points and 10 rebounds in the Timberwolves' 103-99 overtime victory
over the  Houston Rockets  on Sunday. Elias Says The Timberwolves defeated the Rockets 103-99 to post their third consecutive win, all in overtime. Minnesota is the sixth team in NBA history to play three straight overtime games and win them all. The last was the Hawks in 1997.

Blount's 6-for-12 shooting performance -- including his second
3-pointer of the season -- and eight free throws helped ease the
burden. "He's been making it easier," Garnett said of Blount, who
averaged 18 points in his last eight games. The Wolves have won four straight, including the last three in
overtime, and seven of their last nine overall. "They're able to extend the offense, having two 7-footers who
can shoot,"  Tracy McGrady  said. "It allows them to get some
easier chances because we have to defend them out there." McGrady scored 31 points for Houston, which had its five-game
winning streak snapped. It was McGrady's fourth 30-point
performance in five games, but it took him 29 shots to reach it, as
the Wolves constantly threw a second defender at McGrady whenever
he came off a pick. "We formed a wall and made him take tough shots,"  Randy Foye 
said. Shane Battier  added 20 points for the Rockets and  Juwan Howard 
19. But Houston went 12-for-19 from the free throw line, while the
Wolves were 34-for-40. The Rockets attempted two second-half free
throws. "That is obviously problematic," Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. "We scored more points than them in the paint, so we were
obviously going to the basket." Houston led 94-93 with 2:24 to play in overtime before Garnett
sank two foul shots and fed Blount for a layup on Minnesota's next
possession. It gave the Timberwolves a 97-94 lead with 1:29 left. Mike James  added a driving layup for Minnesota after McGrady and
 Rafer Alston  both missed on Houston's ensuing possession. Trenton
Hassell, who guarded McGrady for most of the game, and James each
added two free throws apiece in the final seconds to seal the win. "Not really what we want," Garnett said of the Wolves' third
consecutive overtime game. "But we'll take it any way we can get
it." Houston fell to 5-2 since losing  Yao Ming  to a broken bone in
his right leg. Minnesota led by nine with 7:31 to play in regulation before
Houston went on a 14-3 run and led 84-82 at the 4:15 mark. With 11 seconds left and Minnesota leading 88-86, McGrady drove
the lane and hit a driving, up-and-under layup against Hassell to
make it 88-all. Garnett missed a turnaround with Battier and
 Dikembe Mutombo  in his face to send the game to overtime. McGrady, Alston and Howard combined for 30 of Houston's 40
first-half points, although none of them shot particularly well.
McGrady was 4-for-12 from the floor and 4-for-9 from the foul line. The Wolves, by contrast, stayed close in the first half thanks
to some strong free-throw shooting. Minnesota hit 16 of 18 from the
line and led 44-40 at the break. Game notes Houston is 0-9 when trailing after three quarters. ...
Blount's 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter was the fifth
he's taken this season (2-for-5). ... Mutombo entered the game
averaging 11.6 minutes, but has played 25 minutes a game in his
previous five games. Van Gundy said before the game that he wasn't
concerned yet about putting the mileage on the 40-year-old's body.
... Minnesota played its first of six day games this season. "I
hate waiting all day," coach Dwane Casey said when asked his
thoughts about playing early games.
