SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After losing twice this season to their Northern California rivals, the  Sacramento Kings  got every good bounce this time -- and the  Golden State Warriors  got every bad break, right down to the bone in  Jason Richardson 's hand. Kevin Martin  scored 25 points,  Mike Bibby  had 21 and the Kings parlayed a spectacular first half into a 119-96 victory, snapping a three-game losing streak in this lively series. The Kings' third victory in four games featured a breakout performance by rookie guard  Quincy Douby , who scored 16 of his 21 points in the second quarter alone -- doubling his previous high for an entire game -- as the Kings opened a 36-point lead with an extraordinary effort from their reserves, who made one dominating run after another. "When the crowd was chanting my name, I felt like I was back at Rutgers, taking the tough shots and making them with confidence," Douby said. "It was great that we came into the game with such intensity. We played hard and handed it right back to the Warriors." Golden State got handed more than an embarrassing loss. Richardson could be out for the next two months after breaking his right hand in the second quarter, adding injury to the insult of Sacramento's impressive offensive performance. Martin scored 14 points in the third quarter as the Kings opened a five-game homestand with their most impressive effort in weeks during their third meeting already this season with the Warriors. The Kings received two double-digit beatings in their trips to Oakland this season, but thrived in this one even without starting forward  Kenny Thomas , who sat out with the flu. "It was nice to get a win in that fashion, especially the way they had beat us at Golden State," forward  John Salmons  said. "This was good for our confidence to know we can play with them. You always know what a team did to you the last time. It's always in the back of your mind." Not everything went well for Sacramento. Bibby sat out the fourth quarter after spraining his left ankle late in the third, though the injury's severity wasn't immediately known. Keith McLeod  and  Matt Barnes  scored 17 points apiece, and  Ike Diogu  had a season-high 16 during copious garbage time for the Warriors, who actually started strong before falling apart defensively in just their second loss in six games. Monta Ellis  missed his third straight game with a bruised right shoulder, but  Troy Murphy  returned from a 10-game absence with a sore left foot -- just as the Warriors lost Richardson to what might be the worst problem yet in his injury-plagued year. Richardson apparently was hurt when  Mickael Pietrus  accidentally kicked his teammate's hand while jumping to block a shot. Baron Davis  managed just eight points on 3-of-13 shooting and four assists in the Warriors' worst shooting game of the season -- and the Golden State star's job is about to get harder. "If it ain't one thing, it's another," Davis said. "J-Rich, Monta -- that's a lot of points. I've just got to take on as much as I possibly can." Richardson, who had five points when he was injured, is averaging just 13.1 points and 4.1 rebounds this season after leading Golden State with 23.2 points last season. He missed eight games earlier in December with a bone bruise in his surgically repaired left knee, which hasn't been the same since he underwent arthroscopic surgery in August -- but now he'll have plenty of time to rest it. "It could be a blessing in disguise, so we'll see," Richardson said. The game was frenetic from the opening minutes. Golden State scored 22 points in the first 6:04, but the Kings replied with a 19-2 run led by Bibby, who scored 14 points in the first quarter. Sacramento kept pouring it on, making a 15-4 run before scoring 12 consecutive points moments later. "Their bench came to play," said Barnes, a Sacramento native with about 40 family members and friends in the stands. "They put us out of the game real early. Our shots weren't falling, so there wasn't much we could do." The Kings surpassed their previous season high for points in a half (65) on  Shareef Abdur-Rahim 's jumper with 3:22 still left before halftime. Sacramento led 74-43 at the break after a 39-point second quarter. Game notes   Mike Dunleavy , the Warriors' $45 million backup forward, went 0-for-6 with two turnovers in the first half before coach Don Nelson yanked him. The two had a testy exchange as Dunleavy went to the bench. Dunleavy finished the night 5-for-19, making him 16-of-51 in the last four games. ... Salmons replaced Thomas in the starting lineup.
