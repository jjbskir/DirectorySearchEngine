BOSTON (AP) --  Kevin Garnett  walked off the court raising his right index finger to the cheering crowd. By his side,  Paul Pierce  did the same -- a rare gesture of triumph for the long-suffering Celtics star. There was 2:30 left in the game and Boston had been in control since the middle of the second quarter. The Celtics beat the  Washington Wizards  103-83 on Friday night, opening their most promising season in Pierce's 10 years with the club. "I'm at a place right now in my career, I couldn't ask for anything better," said Pierce, who led Boston with 28 points. Garnett did it all -- 22 points, 20 rebounds, five assists, three blocks and three steals -- in a dazzling debut with Boston. He was introduced to a standing ovation and left to cheers that echoed from the rafters where the team's 16 championship banners were hanging.
