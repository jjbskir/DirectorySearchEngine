TORONTO --  Chris Bosh  put a poor shooting performance behind him in a big way for the  Toronto Raptors . Bosh hit a 16-foot jumper with 2.1 seconds left and the Raptors ended a five-game losing streak with a 106-105 victory over Atlanta on Wednesday night. "I shot it with confidence, and there wasn't a doubt in my mind that it [was] going in," said Bosh. "I'm just glad it gave us the go-ahead to win the game." Bosh was 6 of 19 from the field and finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. "It's not tough at all, because you want to make the next one," Bosh said. "I think every shot after is the one to kind of erase the memory, get the bad taste out of your mouth." He made a second-quarter layup to become the first player in franchise history to reach the 10,000-point plateau. "Something like that is always special," Bosh said. "Just to be the first to do something is always cool." Andrea Bargnani  had 22 points and 11 rebounds for the Raptors, 2-10 in their last 12 games. Jamal Crawford  had a season-high 33 points for the Hawks, who had won four straight and 10 of their last 13.  Al Horford  had 18 points and 14 rebounds,  Mike Bibby  added 17 points and  Maurice Evans  had 16. "I thought we played pretty steady throughout the ball game," Hawks coach Mike Woodson said. "But coming down the stretch we just unraveled and didn't make the plays that we needed to make." Trailing by three at the half, Atlanta used back-to-back 3s from Bibby and Evans -- along with some spotty Toronto shooting -- to help build an eight-point lead late in the third quarter. Evans added another 3 in the final minute to put the Hawks up 86-75 entering the fourth quarter. Bosh's jumper cut it to five, but Evans hit an uncontested 25-footer to end the Raptors' run. That started a 7-0 run, restoring Atlanta's double-digit advantage. The Raptors rallied again, with Bargnani's 3 making it 101-97 with 2:57 remaining.  Sonny Weems  hit a long jumper to make it a two-point game, and the teams traded baskets before  Josh Smith  deflected a rebound out of bounds to give Toronto possession with 22.6 seconds left. Hedo Turkoglu  drew a foul, but made just one of two free throws. Toronto recovered the rebound and called a timeout with 14 seconds left, and Bosh hit the winner. Crawford's off-balance 3-pointer as time expired was well off the mark. DeMar DeRozan  had 19 points for the Raptors, while Turkoglu added 16. Game notes  Raptors G  Antoine Wright  sat out with a sore right knee, while the Hawks were without scoring leader  Joe Johnson  (Achilles' tendinitis). ...
