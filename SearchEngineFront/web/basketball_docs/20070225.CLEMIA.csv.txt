MIAMI -- For the first time in a few days,  Dwyane Wade  had something to enjoy. Shaquille O'Neal  had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Miami held Cleveland to 36 percent shooting in beating the Cavaliers 86-81 Sunday -- the Heat's first win since Wade dislocated his left shoulder last week.

 Neither side could make its free throws in the Heat's 86-81 win over the Cavaliers. Miami made 15 of 30 foul shots; Cleveland made 10 of 21. It was the first NBA game since the shot clock was instituted in 1954 in which both teams took at least 20 foul shots but neither made more than half of them.

Jason Kapono  added 17 points and 11 rebounds for his second career double-double, and  Alonzo Mourning  scored 15 points in 18 minutes for the Heat (27-28), who improved to 2-7 without Wade, the reigning NBA finals MVP who suffered the shoulder injury Wednesday and is expected to miss several weeks. "We have to make every possession count now," O'Neal said. "There's really no room for mistakes now." LeBron James  had game-highs of 29 points and seven assists for the Cavaliers (32-24), who fell to 1-12 when shooting less than 40 percent.  Larry Hughes  added 14 for Cleveland, which also hurt itself by misfiring on 11 of 21 free-throw attempts. Cleveland was outscored 48-28 in the paint, 15-6 in second-chance points and 38-18 in reserve scoring. All that allowed the Heat to survive -- despite shooting only 43 percent from the field, 17 percent from 3-point range and 50 percent from the foul line. "When you look at that team, it has five or six All-Stars. It's a good team," Cleveland coach Mike Brown said. "It's a well-coached team. Just because they didn't have Dwyane Wade, I didn't think -- and I hope our team didn't think -- we could come in here and just get a win." In terms of field-goal percentage defense, it was Miami's second-best effort of the year -- and best against a team with a winning record. The Heat held the  Boston Celtics  to 32 percent shooting on Feb. 7. Take away James' 10-for-22 effort, and the rest of the Cavaliers shot 21-for-64, or 33 percent. "We played, I thought, one of the best defensive games of the year," Heat coach Pat Riley said. "We really have to try to control tempo, slow it down and grind it out defensively, and rebound the basketball. That's going to take a different disposition than we've had in the past." The Heat forced Cleveland into missing seven of its first eight shots in the final quarter, breaking a 59-all tie and taking a 71-62 lead with 8:44 left when Mourning scored after grabbing the rebound of a  Gary Payton  miss. O'Neal put the Heat up 77-69 with 5:22 left, driving the lane for a hard dunk as the shot clock wound down. "The way Shaq has been playing the last few games, they can definitely compete and definitely make the playoffs," James said. James connected on a 3-pointer 34 seconds later, bringing Cleveland within five, but Kapono restored the eight-point margin with 3:35 left when he took O'Neal's pass out of the post and hit a 3-pointer -- ending an 0-for-11 drought from long range for the NBA's 3-point shootout champion and essentially sealing the win. "Early in the fourth quarter, we didn't execute as well as we wanted to," James said. "But late in the game, when we had some great looks, we weren't able to get them to go down." James Posey  added 10 points for Miami, which was 6-for-16 from the foul line in the final quarter -- while Cleveland never got to the line in the final 12 minutes. Anderson Varejao  had 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers, but had only three points on 1-for-6 shooting. Cavs center  Zydrunas Ilgauskas , playing his first game since his wife went into pre-term labor and delivered stillborn twins earlier this month, had eight points and nine rebounds before fouling out with 1:50 left. "For some reason, they always turn it on in the fourth quarter, create separation and we're not able to keep up," Ilgauskas said. Cleveland went 1-for-15 from the field -- including an 0-for-10 stretch -- during an 11-minute span of the opening half, allowing the Heat to erase an early 18-10 deficit and take a 41-38 lead at the break. Both teams shot 8-for-20 in the third, but the Heat warmed up just enough to pull away late and snap a two-game slide. "We know we can do it, but we haven't been doing it," Posey said. "When we decide to do it, it's a beautiful thing. When we can play four quarters like that, we'll be a great team." Game notes  Wade will seek a second opinion this week before deciding between rehabilitation or surgery on his dislocated left shoulder. ... James' woes from the foul line continued: He entered as a 68-percent shooter this season, and was 7-for-12 Sunday. ... Cleveland wore orange throwback uniforms from the 1986-87 season. ...  Antoine Walker  hit his first free throw since Dec. 29, ending an 0-for-10 slump. He's 20-for-60 from the line this season, his .333 percentage the worst among anyone in the league with at least 60 attempts.
