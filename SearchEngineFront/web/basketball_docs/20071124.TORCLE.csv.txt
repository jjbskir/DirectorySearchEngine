CLEVELAND (AP) --  LeBron James  continues to make difficult feats look easy. Cleveland's star forward scored 37 points as part of his third triple-double this season in the Cavaliers' 111-108 victory over the  Toronto Raptors  on Saturday. "If he continues with this scoring and stats, I would hate to see the numbers at the end," Cleveland teammate  Damon Jones  said. "They will be off the charts." In addition to scoring six points in the final minute to seal the win, James had 12 rebounds and 12 assists for the 13th triple-double of his career in the regular season. "He's phenomenal," Cleveland coach Mike Brown said. "He makes the triple-double seem effortless. I have to tell myself not to take it for granted." James' performance was nearly offset by  Chris Bosh , who led Toronto with 41 points to tie his career high. The 6-foot-10 forward was unstoppable near the basket, going 13-of-25 from the field and making 15-of-17 free throws. "There is nothing I don't like about his game," Brown said. "He was incredible." In the end, the decision went to the Cavaliers and James, who took his usual low-key approach to his performance. "It's not really as easy as it may look," he said. "I have to do what is best for the team to win. No matter what plays I have to make, I need to do them." The Cavaliers hit nine 3-pointers in the second half, including six in the third quarter, which ended with the score tied 81-81. Zydrunas Ilgauskas ' layup midway through the fourth quarter put the Cavaliers ahead for good at 88-86. The Cavaliers led 104-100, but  Jason Kapono 's 3-pointer with 57.1 seconds left made it a one-point game. James responded by driving past two defenders to score in the lane for a 106-103 lead with 44 seconds left. Kapono's layup cut the lead to one again before James' fadeaway jumper at the top of the key over  Carlos Delfino  put Cleveland ahead by three with 16.7 seconds left. "I practice that every day," James said of the key shot. "I just took what was there." After  Anthony Parker  missed a 3-pointer from the corner,  Devin Brown 's free throw pushed the lead to four. Another 3-pointer by Kapono made it a one-point game again, but James sealed the win with two foul shots.  Jose Calderon 's shot from just inside midcourt hit off the backboard. Bosh left the game briefly after being accidentally hit above the left eye by James, when he was going for a steal late in the third quarter. Bosh, who was bleeding, went to the locker room for stitches but returned early in the fourth. "I'm trying to be aggressive every game," Bosh said. "I just have to keep it rolling." Daniel Gibson  and Jones, who hit 5-of-9 3-pointers, scored 17 apiece, and Ilgauskas added 16 for Cleveland. The Cavaliers made 13-of-30 3-pointers. "The Cavs and LeBron command so much attention," Toronto coach  Sam Mitchell  said. "You have to force that team to shoot jump shots and try to contest them." Kapono scored 17 for Toronto. The Raptors made eight of their first 11 shots and scored 30 points in the first quarter. James scored 12 of the Cavaliers' 21 points in the period. Toronto built a 12-point lead in the second quarter, which Cleveland cut to 56-52 at halftime. Eight points by James, including two 3-pointers, and 3-pointers by Jones and  Sasha Pavlovic  tied the game at 71 with 3:45 left in the third quarter. Two free throws by James at 3:10 gave Cleveland its first lead, 73-72. Game notes  The win evened Cleveland's home record at 3-3. The Cavaliers were 30-11 at Quicken Loans Arena last season. ...
