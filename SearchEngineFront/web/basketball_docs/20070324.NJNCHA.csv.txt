CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Jason Kidd  launched the jumper and knew the game -- and New Jersey's playoff hopes -- were in big trouble. Enter  Vince Carter , who might have saved the Nets' season. Carter caught Kidd's air ball and dunked it at the buzzer to force overtime, then took over in the extra period in a 40-point outing that led New Jersey to a 113-107 win over the undermanned  Charlotte Bobcats  on Saturday night. "I knew it was short," Kidd said. "But it was straight and I saw two blue jerseys. Then when (No.) 15 rolls up above everybody else, it was up to him to finish. He did a great job. "We got lucky." Indeed. Carter bailed out the Nets, who snapped a two-game losing streak and moved into a three-way tie for seventh place in the Eastern Conference with idle Orlando and Indiana. Carter, who caught the ball in front of the rim and in one motion dunked it behind his head, roared on the court as the buzzer sounded, but was low-key after the game. "I was just in the right place at the right time," Carter said. "It looked short, so I just tried to get there." Carter's three-point play 11 seconds into the extra period put the Nets ahead to stay. His 3-pointer just over a minute later gave the Nets a four-point lead and his two free throws with 22 seconds left put the game away. "It was Tar Heel intervention," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said of Carter, who was back in the state where he starred in college. "Once again we were fortunate." Josh Boone  added a career-high 21 points on 10-of-10 shooting and  Richard Jefferson  scored 16 for the Nets, who avoided an embarrassing loss to the severely short-handed Bobcats. Matt Carroll  matched his career high with 27 points and  Walter Herrmann  added a career-high 20 for Charlotte, which stayed in it without its leading scorer, rebounder, point guard and two other part-time starters. Leading scorer  Gerald Wallace , who suffered severe dehydration after Friday's loss to Philadelphia, did not play. Neither did point guard  Raymond Felton , who bruised his thigh against the 76ers. Top rebounder  Emeka Okafor  missed his 15th straight game with a strained left calf, while  Derek Anderson  (knee) and  Sean May  (knee) remained sidelined. The Bobcats had a far-from-imposing starting lineup of Carroll, Herrmann,  Jake Voskuhl ,  Adam Morrison  and  Brevin Knight , forcing Charlotte to play mostly zone defense. "We had guys sick, guys hurting, but we continued to battle," Knight said. "We knew we didn't have enough bodies to try to run around with their guys. Their athleticism was probably a little too much for us in one-on-one situations." Boone, whose previous career high was 11 points, was the only Net who took advantage of the Bobcats' depleted frontcourt. Playing ahead of  Clifford Robinson , who never got off the bench, Boone also grabbed six rebounds. "When you get down the stretch, it's whoever has it going that night, is going to play," Frank said. Charlotte stayed in it behind Herrmann, who had reached double figures twice in his first 28 games -- and had failed to get off the bench in 34 games -- and Carroll, who shot 11-for-19. "That's your chance and I think Walter has learned that, too," said Carroll, who two years ago was in the developmental league. "He's got some great minutes in the past few games and has taken advantage of it. That's how this league works." Carroll's 3-pointer with 3:36 left gave Charlotte an 89-88 lead. His driving layup with 1:41 left put the Bobcats ahead 92-90. Jefferson's four free throws sandwiched around Herrmann's jumper tied the game with 29 seconds left. Knight's jumper with 8.2 seconds left put Charlotte ahead before Carter's heroics. Charlotte, which lost its second straight, ran out of steam in its second overtime game in five days as the Bobcats remain without a go-to player like Carter. But with Carter eligible to become a free-agent this summer, there is speculation part-owner  Michael Jordan  may try to recruit him. "We'll have to see. It's a long ways away," Carter said. "As of right now, I'm a Net. I'll always be a Net, so we'll just go from there when it's time." Game notes  Nets F  Antoine Wright  air-balled a free throw in the fourth quarter. ... Voskuhl was called for a flagrant foul in the third quarter when he took down Jefferson. ... Bobcats coach Bernie Bickerstaff picked up his 10th technical foul in the third. ... Bickerstaff was a few minutes late for his pregame media availability so he could watch the end of the first half of the Ohio State-Memphis NCAA tournament game. Buckeyes big man Greg Oden could be the No. 1 overall pick -- a pick the Bobcats could have.
