CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The health of Bobcats forward  Gerald Wallace  was the focus after the  Sacramento Kings  used a frantic finish to beat Charlotte. Wallace was knocked unconscious and had to be wheeled off on a stretcher. That the Kings got 22 points and 14 rebounds from  Brad Miller  and then overcame Miller's late turnover to edge the Bobcats 116-115 in overtime was an afterthought. Francisco Garcia  came off the bench to score 23 points and  Ron Artest  scored 20 and hit the go-ahead jumper as the Kings won their third straight game since trading  Mike Bibby  last week. But there was concern on both sides for Wallace. Hit in the nose by an inadvertent elbow from Kings forward  Mikki Moore  early in the third quarter, Wallace was on the floor for nearly 10 minutes before he was taken to a local hospital after his fourth concussion in four years with the Bobcats. "He was knocked out cold," Bobcats guard  Raymond Felton  said. A team official said Wallace regained consciousness and was released from the hospital late Friday. He was suffering from some amnesia, but tests showed no fractures or internal bleeding. Wallace did not accompany the team to Washington for Saturday's game against the Wizards. "He's feeling a little better," coach Sam Vincent said. Without Wallace, the Bobcats rallied from six points down with less than a minute to go in regulation, then had a chance to win it in overtime after Miller's miscue. Miller was trying to avoid being fouled in the closing seconds when his pass deflected off Felton, then hit Miller before landing out of bounds with 3.6 seconds left. Charlotte's inbounds pass went to Felton in the right corner, but his off-balance jumper at the buzzer didn't reach the basket. "I tried to get the ball going to the basket but I had to end up going out toward the 3-point line," Felton said. "At that point I couldn't get all the way to the cup." Jason Richardson  scored 29 points and Felton added 17 points and 10 assists in Charlotte's ninth loss in 10 games Charlotte quickly fell behind by 10 points after losing Wallace, before Richardson led a late surge. Richardson's 3-pointer with 20.2 seconds left cut the deficit to 108-107. Miller was fouled and hit only 1-of-2 free throws, and Felton's driving layup with 11.4 seconds left tied the game. After a timeout,  Kevin Martin  missed a baseline jumper at the buzzer. Continuing his strong play since taking over at point guard for Bibby,  Beno Udrih  had 17 points, eight rebounds and six assists before fouling out late in overtime. Garcia also continued his hot streak in his third game back from a strained back. Garcia hit 6 of 8 3-pointers. "Right now every time he shoots it, we think it's going in," Kings coach Reggie Theus said. But the game that will be best remembered for how quiet the arena got when Wallace crashed to the floor. While double-teaming Moore, Wallace was called for a foul as Moore wheeled toward the basket. As Moore continued his move, Moore's right elbow struck Wallace directly in the nose. "I just went straight up and he came into me," said Moore, who was visibly shaken while Wallace was being attended to. "I'm going to pray on it all night. Hopefully he'll have a speedy recovery."
