OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- On a night filled with poor shooting, the
New Orleans Hornets were fortunate to have  Jannero Pargo  on their bench. 	   Pargo scored a season-high 25 points, 21 of them after halftime
as the Hornets scraped past the  Orlando Magic  84-78 in overtime
Tuesday night.

 The Magic took the Hornets to overtime but then managed to score only three points in the extra period, all coming on Keyon Dooling's 3-pointer with seven seconds left in OT. Only seven teams in NBA history have been held scoreless in overtime; the last to do it was the Vancouver Grizzlies on Dec. 1, 2000.

   Pargo was 10-of-18 from the field, made three of his four
3-pointers and sank both his free throws. His teammates combined to
go 20-of-62 from the floor as the Hornets shot just 37.5 percent. 	   "He made open shots, he made guarded shots, he made tough shots
and he made buzzer-beater shots," teammate  Rasual Butler  said. "He hit almost everything that came his way. He kept us in the
game." 	   Orlando's point total was a season low and the Magic shot just
34.9 percent (29-of-83) in losing their third straight. After
managing to get the game to overtime, they didn't score until the
final 10 seconds of the extra period. 	    Desmond Mason  scored 21 points, and Butler had 19 points and
tied his career high with 11 rebounds as the Hornets won their
third straight. 	    Dwight Howard  had 17 points and 15 rebounds for the Magic. Hedo
Turkoglu scored 16 and  Jameer Nelson  had a dozen. 	   A jumper by Butler to start overtime gave the Hornets a 77-75
lead. Orlando then missed two shots and turned it over twice before
 Devin Brown  sank two free throws for a 79-75 lead. After Mason made
one of two free throws with 27.4 seconds left, Butler kept the ball
alive and Pargo added two more free throws to make it 82-75 with
23.1 seconds to play. 	   Orlando's only basket in overtime was a 3-pointer by Keyon
Dooling with 7.7 seconds left. 	   Pargo made a jumper with 2:29 left in regulation to give the
Hornets a 73-71 lead. Nelson tied it with a baseline jumper with
36.1 seconds left before Mason sank two free throws with 18.4 to
play to put New Orleans in front again. 	   Howard made one of two free throws with 6.5 seconds remaining.
 Darko Milicic , who scored 11, was fouled grabbing the rebound of
Howard's miss, and he sank the second of two from the line to tie
it at 75. Milicic then blocked a driving shot by Pargo with 1.7
seconds left and the Hornets turned it over on the ensuing inbounds
play as time expired. 	   "At the start of overtime, our players were just talking to
each other and saying how we were going to win the game," Hornets
coach Byron Scott said. "We came out and did a great job of
getting stops." 	   After scoring a season-low 33 points in the first half, the
Magic started quickly in the third period to get within 42-41. The
Hornets responded with a 6-0 run to build the lead to seven points,
then Pargo scored 11 of their final 13 to keep them in front. 	   "What can I say? I had a hand right in his face and I got the
ball on the way up some of the time," Nelson said. "He made tough
shots, so you just take your hat off to him. He came in and did his
job." 	   Orlando scored only 14 points in the second quarter when it was
5-of-17 with six turnovers. Game Notes Hornets fans remain standing until the home team makes a
