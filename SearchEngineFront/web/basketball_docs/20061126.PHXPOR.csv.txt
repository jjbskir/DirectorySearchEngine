PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The  Phoenix Suns ' rebound appears to be
complete. After a 1-5 start to the season, the Suns have gone 6-1 and won
their fourth straight in a 119-101 rout of the Portland Trail
Blazers on Sunday night. "That was maybe our best game of the year," reigning MVP Steve
Nash said. Raja Bell  had a season-high 30 points, including seven
3-pointers, and all four of his fellow starters scored in double
figures as Phoenix led by as many 25 points.  Amare Stoudemire ,
coming back from surgery on his left knee that forced him to miss
all but three games last season, had 20 points and 11 rebounds. "We're definitely back," Stoudemire said. Nash had 23 points and 10 assists.  Boris Diaw  and  Shawn Marion 
each scored 17. "I thought it was our best 48 minutes. We put it together,"
coach Mike D'Antoni said. Zach Randolph  had 18 points and nine rebounds, but left the game
late in the fourth quarter and did not return. Travis Outlaw  added a career-high 22 points for the Blazers, 2-7
in their last nine games after opening the season 4-2. For a second straight game, an ankle sprain sidelined Suns guard
 Leandro Barbosa , whose average of 18.5 points per game ranks second
on the team. The Blazers were still without rookie  Brandon Roy  (heel), center
 Joel Przybilla  (groin) and forward  Raef LaFrentz  (calf). Przybilla
is expected to return to practice this week. Randolph, Portland's top scorer, left the court late in the
third quarter, and had his knees iced on the bench. He did not
return. "They took a lot of life and energy out of us," Randolph said.
"Yeah, I was frustrated. We need to keep playing and keep
focused." The Blazers closed to 39-36 in the first half, but Stoudemire
scored six points as the Suns went on an 13-2 run to make it 52-38. Diaw's 3-pointer put Phoenix up 85-62, and two consecutive
3-pointers from Marion and Bell extended the lead to 93-68. "You can't ask for a whole lot more that to have open shots and
somebody like Steve putting it in your hands," Bell said. "All
you really have to do is shoot it." Sergio Rodriguez  made a layup that narrowed it to 100-85 for the
Blazers in the final quarter. It was as close as they would come. "I don't want to go crazy here. You're looking at a very young
team that doesn't have all of its players healthy," Blazers coach
Nate McMillan said. "Right now we don't have that experience and
leadership that other veteran teams have. You don't have that
All-Star to pull things together. Zach is trying to become that but
he needs some help to do it." Bell fell a point short of his career-high 31 points, set
against Seattle on Jan. 22. His seven 3-pointers were a season
high. "We're giving a more consistent effort defensively and that's
the biggest difference for the start of the season," Nash said. Game Notes The Suns went 3-1 against the Trail Blazers last season and
have won six of the last seven meetings. Last season's 130-85
victory over the Blazers was the Suns' widest margin of the season.
... Blazers rookie  LaMarcus Aldridge  was hit in the lip in the
first half and needed five stitches. He returned in the second half
bu played sparingly.
