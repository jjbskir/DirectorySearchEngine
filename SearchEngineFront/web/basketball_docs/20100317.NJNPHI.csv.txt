PHILADELPHIA --  Andre Iguodala  went back to basics for the  Philadelphia 76ers . Two nights after missing 17 shots, including all seven of his 3-pointers, and finishing 5 for 22 in a loss to New York, Iguodala responded in a big way this time by driving to the basket against New Jersey. Iguodala scored 20 points,  Jrue Holiday  added 19 points, seven rebounds and seven assists and the Philadelphia snapped a five-game losing streak with a 108-97 victory over the Nets on Wednesday night. "I tried to set the tone early by being aggressive," said Iguodala, who was 7 of 14 from the field and 6 of 7 on free throws. He also had eight assists and four rebounds. "I was looking for my spots on the floor and where to attack and where to look for my open teammates," Iguodala said. "I wanted to get to the basket whenever I could." Elton Brand  added 12 points, and  Lou Williams ,  Willie Green  and  Rodney Carney  had 11 each to help the 76ers improve to 24-44 with their second victory in 12 games. Philadelphia shot 56 percent from the field and completed a 4-0 sweep of the Nets for the first time in 33 years. "This was a scary game for us," Brand said. "Their record was not indicative of the type of talent they have. We knew we had to have this game." Chris Douglas-Roberts  led the Nets (7-61) with 23 points,  Keyon Dooling  added 15 and  Terrence Williams  had 13.  Brook Lopez  and  Jarvis Hayes  also scored 12 apiece, and  Kris Humphries  had 10. New Jersey needs to win three of its last 14 games to avoid the NBA record for fewest victories set by the 1972-73 76ers when they went 9-73. "We just have to stay competitive and keep the pressure on," Nets acting coach Kiki Vandeweghe said. Magic Johnson  watched from a front-row seat as two of the worst teams in the league played in the half-empty arena. The Hall of Famer will be a guest speaker at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business on Thursday. "You have to find positives no matter what," Douglas-Roberts said. "You have to realize it's just one season and our goal should be not to get that record." The 76ers quickly extended a 13-point lead to 17 early in the fourth with consecutive baskets by Brand and Williams, giving them an 89-72 lead. New Jersey never got within single digits the rest of the way. "We wanted to put them away," Brand said. "We didn't want them to get close enough in the fourth." After the Sixers built a 79-57 lead, the Nets outscored Philadelphia 11-2, with Douglas-Roberts scoring nine points to cut it to 81-68 after the third.
