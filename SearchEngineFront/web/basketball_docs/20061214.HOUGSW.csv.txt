OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --  Baron Davis  got the ball with the clock
winding down, glanced to the sideline and saw that coach Don Nelson
had no plans for a timeout.

 Yao Ming had 38 points and 18 rebounds in Houston's loss against Golden State. It's his second 35/15 (points/rebounds) game this season. No other player has done that even once this season. The last player with more than one such game in one season before New Year's Day was Shaquille O'Neal in 2001.

 Thanks to  Adonal Foyle 's screen on  Yao Ming  moments later, Davis
had an open look -- and he launched it. Davis hit a long 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left to lift Golden
State to a 109-107 victory over Houston on Thursday night, ending
the Warriors' three-game losing streak to the Rockets. "I just had enough time to set my feet and let it fly," Davis
said. "And it went in." Yao matched his season high with 38 points and grabbed a
season-best 18 rebounds, but missed his final two shots in the
closing seconds. After one of those misses, Golden State got a
final chance, and Davis capitalized for the Warriors' third
straight win at home. "I put the ball in the hands of my best player," Nelson said.
"In an open-court situation, he's the boss. I'm not." Mike Dunleavy 's three-point play with 29.3 seconds left got the
Warriors within 107-106, then Yao missed on the other end. Yao also
couldn't hit a desperation shot at the buzzer. The Warriors tried
to wear him down by using several different defenders on him. "I'm tired, but I just didn't make that shot," Yao said. "An
early lead in this game, in the NBA, it doesn't mean that much. ...
We still had a chance to win it. In the final 30 seconds, we're up
four and they score six points. That's the game won right there." Davis finished with 34 points and eight assists to lead five
Warriors in double figures, but had his stretch of three straight
double-doubles snapped.  Monta Ellis  had 17 points and six assists,
and  Andris Biedrins  added 15 points off the bench for Golden State. Luther Head  had a season-high 26 points and nine rebounds, and
 Rafer Alston  added 19 points, eight assists and six boards for
Houston, which kicked off a five-game road trip with a tough
defeat. The Rockets are in a stretch where they play 10 of 12 games
away from the Toyota Center. Yao grabbed seven offensive rebounds after not getting one in 2 
games, since the first half at Charlotte on Dec. 8. Alston and  Shane Battier  hit consecutive 3-pointers in crunch
time to keep the Rockets in it. Yao scored six straight points,
including consecutive 12-foot turnaround jumpers, during a 13-0 run
to start the third quarter as the Rockets built a 63-52 lead. Biedrins converted a three-point play with 43.1 seconds left in
the third and a technical on  Bonzi Wells  allowed the Warriors to
score four during the sequence, pulling them within 78-73. Dunleavy
added two free throws in the closing seconds of the period to make
it a three-point game heading into the fourth. Davis then had a three-point play on the Warriors' first
possession of the final quarter to tie it. The 6-foot-10 Foyle earned a rare start -- only his second this
season -- for Golden State and had to guard the 7-6 Yao, who didn't
attempt his first shot until 3  minutes in only to have Foyle block
it. "Foyle looked like a point guard trying to play him," Nelson
said. "Incredible. What a man, what a man." Warriors forward  Troy Murphy  did not dress as he nurses a sore
left Achilles tendon and guard  Jason Richardson  missed his sixth
straight game with a bone bruise in his left knee. Golden State now goes on the road for a six-game, nine-day road
trip starting Friday at Phoenix. "I'm looking forward to it to see how we fare," Nelson said.
"It'd be good to play better on the road." Houston's  Tracy McGrady  missed his second straight game with
back spasms. The Rockets are 9-32 without their star guard in the
lineup dating to the 2004-05 season. Houston missed its first nine shots, three by Yao, and committed
four quick turnovers. Head scored the Rockets' first points with a
three-point play at the 8:15 mark of the first quarter. Game notes Biedrins didn't start for only the fifth time this year,
two nights after the 20-year-old made all seven of his field-goal
tries and went 6-for-6 at the line. ... The Rockets are 1-5 on the
road against the Western Conference. ... Houston coach Jeff Van
Gundy wants to see more intensity from second-year F  Chuck Hayes .
"Sometimes he's going to get in foul trouble. He's aggressive by
nature," Van Gundy said. "I'm more concerned about a lack of
sustained energy for a three- or four-game period." ... The
Warriors sold out Oracle Arena for the second time this season.
