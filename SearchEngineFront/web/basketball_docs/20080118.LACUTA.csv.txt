SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The  Utah Jazz  can usually count on winning at home, especially when the  Los Angeles Clippers  come to town. The Jazz recovered from a humbling loss the night before by blowing out the Clippers 106-88 on Friday night. Utah easily beat the Clippers for the ninth straight time in Salt Lake City, taking a 14-point lead by halftime and never letting it get closer than 10. "We came back and stayed ready and we were focused out there," said  Carlos Boozer , who had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Utah. The Jazz improved to 17-3 at home, but had a woeful first half of the season on the road. A 120-109 loss at Denver on Thursday dropped Utah to 6-15 on the road. Coach Jerry Sloan was pleased with the turnaround the Jazz made overnight, but perplexed and concerned with the disparity between playing at home and on the road. "Somewhere there has to be a passion to play this game on the road. If it's a job for you, why do it?," Sloan said. "I know it's corny, but it's really been kind of disheartening to see us play on the road the way we have." Deron Williams  scored 15 and  Andrei Kirilenko  added 13 points and seven assists for Utah. All five Jazz starters scored in double figures and got to rest for the final few minutes of Utah's ninth straight home win over the Clippers. The Jazz let a close game slip away in the second half Thursday night at Denver. Back at home Friday, the Jazz never let it get close. Utah is 23-18 halfway through the season and opens the second half Monday afternoon against the Clippers in Los Angeles. "I think we still have a long time to play. It's not time to panic or anything, but we've definitely got to [win] on the road," Williams said. "On the road, we just don't have it." Corey Maggette  scored 20 and  Chris Kaman  had 16 points and 16 rebounds for the Clippers, who are 1-30 in EnergySolutions Arena -- originally known as the Delta Center. Sam Cassell  had 16 points and  Tim Thomas  scored 11 for the struggling Clippers. Los Angeles, which snapped a four-game losing streak Tuesday against Phoenix, has lost 11 of 13. The Clippers had 15 turnovers and were outrebounded 43-34. "We know their stuff pretty well and we let them get easy scores. We were not sharp mentally," coach  Mike Dunleavy  said. "It was like we didn't even have a shootaround today." Mehmet Okur  and  Ronnie Brewer  each scored 12 for the Jazz. Since falling to .500 at 16-16 with a loss to the Celtics on Dec. 29, the Jazz have won seven of nine. The Jazz led 59-45 at halftime, then blew the game open in the third quarter after the Clippers opened with a mini-run. Kaman's dunk with 8:44 left in the third cut the lead to 65-55. Later in the period, Kirilenko grabbed an offensive rebound under the basket and dunked it to put Utah up 83-65, then made a steal and went in all alone for another dunk that increased the lead to 20. Kaman scored on a putback for the Clippers, then Okur answered with a 3-pointer and Utah's lead was up to 88-67 late in the third quarter. "We've been playing pretty well and they just came out and played harder than us. And that's surprising because they had a game last night," Kaman said. The Clippers trimmed it to 88-71 after  Brevin Knight  was fouled with .1 second left in the third quarter and made two of three free throws and Thomas opened the fourth with a basket, but the Jazz responded with a 10-2 run.
