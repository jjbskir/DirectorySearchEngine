HOUSTON (AP) --  Rafer Alston  and  Desmond Mason  squared off near midcourt in the first quarter, shouting at each other after Mason's hard foul on  Tracy McGrady . Elias Says Chandler  Tyson Chandler had 12 rebounds in the Hornets' win at Houston. Chandler has had at least a dozen rebounds in each of his past six games, the longest such streak for a Hornets player since Anthony Mason set the franchise record with seven in a row in March 1997.  Read more  Elias Says . After McGrady went 1-for-2 from the line, Alston and Mason kept bickering until referee Sean Corbin ejected them. The confrontation was the perfect fit for an ugly game Saturday night Devin Brown  had 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists to lead the New Orleans Hornets to an 87-74 victory over the bad-shooting  Houston Rockets . Tyson Chandler  had 11 points and 12 rebounds,  Chris Paul  had 12 points with nine assists, and the Hornets won for the ninth time in 13 games. "It was an ugly one," said Chandler, "but we'll take it." Paul shot 4-of-12 in his third game back after missing 17 because of a sprained right ankle. He was close enough to hear Alston and Mason arguing after Mason fouled McGrady with 4:07 left in the opening quarter. "It's just the heat of the moment," Paul said. "Some things were said that were uncalled for and I support Desmond in the fullest." The tension began after Alston stole the ball from Mason and found McGrady trailing on the fast break. Mason slapped McGrady's arm and McGrady hit the floor, landing on his left wrist. As McGrady clutched his wrist and prepared to shoot free throws, Alston and Mason faced off, each drawing a technical foul from Corbin. Alston and Mason were still talking as McGrady shot his free throws and Corbin had seen enough. "It was an exchange of words," Alston said. "Words led to more words, words got out of hand, words that you can't say on television." Mason did not speak to the media after the game. Houston coach Jeff Van Gundy said both players should've known better. "It's inexplicable," Van Gundy said, "that it was more important to get the last word in, then it was thinking about your team's needs." After Alston and Mason left the court, McGrady went to the bench to get his wrist taped by trainer Keith Jones. McGrady didn't think Mason's foul was excessive. "I didn't think anything of it," McGrady said. "It was a hard NBA foul. I was cool with it. I'm sure he didn't try to hurt me." McGrady came back to score 18 points for the Rockets, who had a four-game winning streak snapped. Houston shot 37 percent (29-of-78) and matched season lows for points in a first quarter (15) and first half (30). The Hornets also outrebounded the Rockets 49-36 and scored 20 points off Houston's 12 turnovers. "I told them before the game that it would be an ugly game," New Orleans coach Byron Scott said. "It was, but I'll take a win in any game." McGrady missed five of his first six shots, part of the Rockets' 9-for-33 start, and the Hornets built a 30-24 lead. But New Orleans, the league's lowest-scoring team, was hardly rolling. The Hornets shot 32 percent (12-of-38) in the first half and led only 33-30 at the break. Paul had only two points at halftime, but hit a 3-pointer and drove for a layup early in the third quarter to preserve the Hornets' lead. Brown and  Rasual Butler  added 3-pointers to put New Orleans up 48-37. "We were really focused and our guys didn't lose their focus when our shots weren't falling in the first half," Scott said. The Rockets missed six of nine shots and coughed up four turnovers over the next six minutes as the Hornets opened a 61-43 lead. Brown hit a jumper from the free throw line and  Jannero Pargo  sank a 3-pointer early in the fourth to stretch New Orleans' lead to 70-51. John Lucas  nailed a 3-pointer and  Bonzi Wells  drove for a dunk during a 9-3 Houston burst, but Paul hit two free throws with 4:28 left to push the Hornets' lead to 75-60. Brown made two 3-pointers on the Hornets' next two possessions, prompting fans to head for the exits. The Rockets avoided the team record for lowest point total (66) when  Steve Novak  hit a 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining to make it 82-68. Even though Houston had won four in a row coming into the game, Van Gundy knew his team had not been playing its best. "Sometimes, you're getting results that you like even though the play isn't what you'd like," Van Gundy said. "We're forgetting how hard it is to win."
