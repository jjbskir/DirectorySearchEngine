MILWAUKEE -- One night after having to leave the game with a migraine headache,  Milwaukee Bucks  center  Andrew Bogut  was a pain for the  Indiana Pacers . Bogut returned to the lineup and had 21 points and eight rebounds, helping the Bucks hold off the Indiana Pacers 93-81 for their fifth win in six games. Bogut said he still had a headache Saturday, but was able to play through it. He left the Bucks' game Friday against the  New York Knicks  in the first quarter after his left side went numb and he "couldn't feel the ball." "It is a pretty traumatic thing for me when I go through these migraines," he said. "It was good to have a good start and hit my first three or four shots." In the second half, Bogut said he had to fight through fatigue, but still managed to hit two key shots in the fourth quarter as the Pacers fought back from an early 18-point deficit. Overall, he hit 9-of-15 shots. "In the second half, my legs were completely gone," he said. "I am going to get some rest tonight and do absolutely nothing tomorrow." Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  thought Bogut showed plenty of energy. "He had good life, no question about it," Skiles said. Luc Mbah a Moute added season-high 18 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Bucks, recording his first double-double of the season. For Mbah a Moute, who is known as a defensive specialist, it was a rare offensive outburst. "I was just trying to attack the glass and play as hard as I can," he said. "My teammates did a good job of finding me and I was able to hit the shots when I was open." Pacers coach Jim O'Brien had high praise for Mbah a Moute. "He was terrific," O'Brien said. "He was very active, very live and very quick to the ball -- much quicker than our guys in going to the glass and creating havoc." T.J. Ford  led the Pacers with a season-high 20 points and  Danny Granger  added 14. Ford played because the Pacers were without starting point guard  Earl Watson , who missed his second straight game due a death in his family. For Ford, it was a rare opportunity to get on the court this season after not playing in 18 straight games until the Pacers' Friday night win against Detroit. "That's what we get paid to do," Ford said. "Whether you're playing or not, it's always be ready. I'm not trying to make any demands or cause a problem. Of course, I want to play. It's up to the coach and what he feels is best for the team right now. " The Pacers got within six in the fourth quarter after  Mike Dunleavy  hit two free throws with 5:42 remaining. But  Brandon Jennings  answered with a 3-pointer with 5:29 remaining, his first points of the game after missing his first five shots. Carlos Delfino  saved the ball from going out of bounds after a steal and hit a shot from the corner to give the Bucks an 85-74 lead with 4:57 remaining. Pacers rookie guard  A.J. Price  left the game with 6:26 remaining in the third quarter after he was hit in the face on a drive to the basket. After he was on the court for several minutes, he went straight to the Pacers' locker room and did not return. The Pacers said he had a concussion and would be evaluated by the team's doctor. Game notes  The win was the Bucks' seventh in a row at home. They haven't lost at the Bradley Center since Dec. 26, a 112-97 loss to the  San Antonio Spurs . ... Pacers G  Luther Head  missed his second straight game with a viral infection. Bucks guard  Charlie Bell  has now hit a 3-pointer in nine consecutive games and 16 of this last 17.
