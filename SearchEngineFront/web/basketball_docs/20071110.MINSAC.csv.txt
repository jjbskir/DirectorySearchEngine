SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --  Kevin Martin  finally came through for Sacramento. After an ugly first half, he scored 24 of his 29 points in the second half and  Brad Miller  had 16 rebounds and 12 points to lead the  Sacramento Kings  100-93 over the winless  Minnesota Timberwolves  on Saturday night. "There's going to be nights like that for him because he shoots so many [free throws]," Miller said. "I just like teasing him about it until he starts making them." John Salmons  had 19 points and three steals for the Kings, who were playing at home for the second night in a row. "It was really rough all around," he said. "But my teammates kept supporting me." Al Jefferson  had 17 points and 12 rebounds and  Rashad McCants  came off the bench to score 16 points for Minnesota in a game that was tied 21 times. Neither team could get much distance after halftime, and  Sebastian Telfair  made a 3-pointer to send the teams into the fourth quarter tied at 73. Minnesota took an 89-88 lead on two free throws by rookie  Corey Brewer  with 4:13 left. But the Kings regained it when Martin hit three straight free throws and Miller made two for a 94-90 lead with 1:28 to play. McCants hit a 3-pointer on the next possession, but Udrih hit a basket to keep the Timberwolves down by three. "That's kind of what we expect him to do," Sacramento coach Reggie Theus said. "We know that that's what he's capable of doing." After Garcia won a jump ball, Miller tipped in a missed basket to seal the victory.
