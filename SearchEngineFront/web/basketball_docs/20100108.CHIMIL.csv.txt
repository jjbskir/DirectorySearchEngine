MILWAUKEE --  Andrew Bogut  and the Bucks reached a tipping point against the Bulls after Chicago overcame a 17-point deficit and began pulling away in the fourth quarter. After a cheap foul, an exchange of words and a few shoves, Milwaukee's 7-footer took a different approach. With officials reviewing the tape to assess who should receive technical fouls, Bogut called the team together. "We had to calm down," said  Hakim Warrick , who was in the scrum and received a technical. "That's what Andrew did. He got us in, told us to take a deep breath, stick together, and we did." Bogut had 27 points, 13 rebounds and a career-high six blocks, and  Michael Redd  added 24 points to rally the Bucks to their third straight win, 96-93 over the Bulls on Friday night. "[It was] a little bit physical, a little bit testy at times, but I think that got us going," Bogut said. "We went on a run after that, got the lead back and won the game." Derrick Rose  scored 25 points and  Joakim Noah  had 10 points and 18 rebounds, but the Bulls dropped their third straight after a four-game winning streak. Bogut and Redd provided most of the offense in the closing minutes, combining for 22 points in the last 7:09 as Milwaukee rallied from a 76-69 deficit. "We were tougher," Redd said. "That's what it comes down to against Chicago." The rest of the Bucks stepped up on defense, holding Chicago without a field goal for nearly 7 minutes as Milwaukee built an 88-80 lead. But the Bulls nearly came back again. Luol Deng  hit a jumper, Rose added a layup and  Brad Miller  made a 3 to cut it to 93-91 with 1:01 left. Chicago had a chance to tie it at the buzzer. John Salmons  inbounded to Deng, who passed it back to Salmons. Salmons went up for a shot, but sent it back to Deng, who missed an open 27-footer as time expired. "John made a nice pass to Louie. He had a good look but we were unable to knock it down," Bulls coach  Vinny Del Negro  said. There was little else nice that happened in a rough and tumble game that could've become much more serious with 10:12 to go. Kirk Hinrich  drew a foul on  Luke Ridnour , and Bogut began jawing at him when the pushing and shoving ensued. Hinrich said he got hit late by Warrick. "I was going to the lane and Warrick gave me like a forearm, like 3 seconds after the whistle," Hinrich said. Officials assessed technicals on Hinrich,  Tyrus Thomas , Bogut and Warrick, however no punches were thrown and Bulls and Bucks assistants made sure no one left the bench while officials reviewed the incident for several minutes. "Just a lot of shoving. Nothing much. A lot of pushing back," Del Negro said. "You've got to control your emotions in those situations. It kind of started the play before that on the out of bounds play, they were pushing and shoving. But it was nothing." But that nothing was the spark Milwaukee might be able to use with its tough upcoming stretch. The Bucks begin a six-game Western trip on Sunday against the Lakers, followed by stops in Phoenix, Portland, Golden State, Utah and Houston over nine days. "To go on the West Coast trip now with a big win like this, it's huge," Bogut said. "We were struggling before the New Year and people were questioning whether we're all together as a team. ... It's good to know your teammates got your back." Game notes  Milwaukee is 11-1 this season when Bogut scores 17 points or more. ... Ridnour hit a 40-footer at the third-quarter buzzer to tie the game at 64. ... The Bucks used a 19-0 run in the first quarter to open a 17-point lead. ... Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  said the staff had addressed the team about the Wizards' situation that caused  Gilbert Arenas  to be indefinitely suspended by the league, but declined to discuss the team's policy on gambling.
