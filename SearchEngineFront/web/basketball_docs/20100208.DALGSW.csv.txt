OAKLAND, Calif. --  Jason Terry  spent the postgame lying on his back, his feet propped up on a folding chair, with a bag of ice tucked in the waist band of his shorts. It was just his way of relaxing after a hard night at work. Terry scored a season-high 36 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer, and the  Dallas Mavericks  rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat the  Golden State Warriors  127-117 on Monday night.

 "The best thing you can do is put pressure on them, don't settle and just play as hard as you can," Terry said. "If they outhustle you, they're going to win the game. It's my job is to go out and perform at a high level every night that I'm out there." Josh Howard  and  Drew Gooden  also had season bests with 25 and 24 points respectively for the Mavericks.  Jason Kidd  added 17 points and 12 assists. "This was a bit of a gut check for us," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. "It was a game we desperately needed and we fought hard for." Anthony Morrow  scored a season-high 33 points and had 11 rebounds to lead the Warriors, who lost their season-worst ninth straight, including five at home.  Monta Ellis  scored 27 points before leaving the game with an apparent right knee injury in the final four minutes. "I don't know what to tell you with another injury we don't need," Warriors' coach Don Nelson said. "We didn't need any of them. I hope it's not serious." Stephen Curry  scored 25 points to go with nine assists. Morrow scored 12 of his points in the second quarter to lift Golden State to a 70-61 halftime lead. The Warriors led 98-90 after the third period. "I'd rather us win the game then me score however many points," Morrow said. "We have a lot of losses piling but everybody is still upbeat and playing together." Golden State had a 14-point lead midway through the first quarter and never trailed until  Dirk Nowitzki  converted a three-point play with 6:40 remaining to play. Nowitzki, who came off the bench for the first time in over 10 years in the Mavericks last game, finished with 15 points and eight rebounds. "Our guys just stuck with it," Carlisle said. "They really wanted to win this game and put an awful lot of effort and collective will into it. We'll look to build off this. It's been a tough 10-day stretch. We've had struggles but it's a long year." Morrow hit consecutive baskets to put the Warriors back on top, but Terry hit a 3-pointer with 5:30 left to give the Mavericks the lead for good. Kidd had steals on the next two Warriors' possessions, allowing Dallas to inch ahead and eventually build its own double-digit lead. "When you can't afford a turnover we had a ton of them," Nelson said. "We tried to get to the right spots but something always happened." The Warriors had beaten Dallas in five of six previous meetings at home and have now lost six straight to first-place teams. The Mavericks rallied from a double-digit deficit for the 11th time, the most in the NBA. Game notes  Mavericks' C  Erick Dampier  missed the game with a swollen knee. ...
