NEW ORLEANS (AP) --  Kobe Bryant  appears to be getting comfortable with the idea that he doesn't even need to score 20 points to help the  Los Angeles Lakers  win. Bryant scored 19 points,  Andrew Bynum  added 17 and the Los Angeles Lakers won their fourth straight game, 109-80 over the  New Orleans Hornets  on Wednesday night. "My role now has changed," said Bryant, whose scoring average is down from 31.6 points per game last season to 26.4 through 34 games this season. "I'm not the guy who has to go out and score 35-something points. They come to me to get buckets when we need a little boost here and there and that's as it should be." With balanced scoring and stifling defense, the Lakers turned what was supposed to be a marquee matchup between two of the NBA's hottest teams into a lopsided affair that left the home crowd groaning. "We were very passive," Hornets coach Byron Scott said. "We just didn't come out ready to play." Mirror Image? Just like last season the Lakers are off to a 23-11 start, but they're surely hoping that history doesn't repeat itself. After 34 games last year, the Lakers lost back-to-back games and went 10-21 over their next 31 games to contribute to a 42-40 finish. Here's a look at the Lakers' first 34 games the last two seasons.

 The Lakers made 54.9 percent of their shots, hitting nine 3-pointers while outscoring New Orleans 52-36 inside. Bryant had seven assists, while Bynum, who had nine rebounds, outplayed Hornets center  Tyson Chandler , who finished with 11 points and seven rebounds. Having won in Memphis a night earlier and facing a Hornets squad that was well-rested after winning three straight on the road last week, Los Angeles scored on its first eight possessions and led by double digits for most of the game. "It's a tough loss for us after winning three pretty good road games," said  Chris Paul , who led the Hornets with 32 points. "Maybe it was a lack of energy or just a lack of focus. They made shots. I don't think it was so much of what we didn't do as what they did well." The disparity in scoring among both teams' reserves was a telling sign of how well the Lakers have played in winning 10 of their last 12 games. Los Angeles' reserves outscored the Hornets' bench 42-9. The Lakers also outrebounded New Orleans 45-40. "We're doing a great job getting the spacing, knocking down shots and making teams pay," Bryant said. "We just come out and play with a lot of energy. We moved the ball very well and it's tough for teams to match up with and to guard because everybody's moving." David West  added 19 points for New Orleans, which shot 36.9 percent, hurt in part by 1-of-11 shooting from 3-point range as a team. Luke Walton  scored 14 for the Lakers, while  Lamar Odom  added 11 and  Trevor Ariza  10. The Hornets had chiseled a 19-point deficit to seven early in the second half when Bryant helped Los Angeles take the game over for good. His 3-pointer from the left wing started a 10-2 run that quickly extended the Lakers' lead to 64-49. Bryant later hit a driving layup and another 3-pointer with  Morris Peterson  in his face, then Odom added a pair of baskets underneath during another 10-0 run that put Los Angeles ahead 80-60 with under 4 minutes to go in the third quarter. New Orleans was unable to get closer than 14 points thereafter. Bryant and Bynum each scored eight points in the first quarter to help the Lakers open an early double-digit lead, and it only got worse when Lakers coach Phil Jackson put his reserves in to open the second quarter. Ariza,  Ronny Turiaf ,  Kwame Brown  and  Javaris Crittenton  all scored during a 13-2 run that gave Los Angeles a 49-30 lead. West, who scored 17 points in the first half, hit a pair of free throws and had a one-handed dunk on a putback to help spark the Hornets' 9-2 run to end the half. Tyson Chandler finished it off with an alley-oop dunk from Paul, pulling New Orleans to 54-43 at halftime. The Lakers wouldn't allow the home crowd much to cheer about after that, however. "We established something early in the game and were able to control the tempo," Jackson said. "This was a really good road win for us." Game notes  Paul and  Derek Fisher  each were assessed technical fouls in the third quarter after exchanging words under the Hornets' basket. ... Attendance was announced at 15,605. Earlier Wednesday, the Hornets announced a two-year lease extension until 2014, but the new agreement also allows the team to opt out if average attendance is lower than 14,735 in games between last Dec. 1 and the end of next season. ... The Lakers (23-11) have won seven of last their nine road games. ... The Hornets (23-12) are 9-7 at home this season.
