MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The  New Jersey Nets  couldn't have asked for a better time to play the league-worst  Memphis Grizzlies .
 Elias Says The Grizzlies lost to the Nets on Monday after Memphis had defeated the Bobcats on Saturday. Monday's loss means that 65 games into the season, the Grizzlies still have not had a two-game winning streak. Only three other teams in NBA history have gone this many games into a season without winning back-to-back games: the 2004-05 Hawks and 1986-87 Clippers each went through the entire 82-game schedule without winning consecutive games; the 2002-03 Cavaliers didn't have their first until their 69th and 70th games of the season.

Bostjan Nachbar  added 14 points Carter also had 10 rebounds and had five assists. "It's good to get back with a win," New Jersey coach Lawrence Frank.

"I don't have any explanation for us not playing with a sense of urgency," Barone said. "We didn't play with urgency all night or from the beginning of the game." Barone said his efforts to put fire up the Grizzlies have not been successful. "We tried to explain to them all the teams coming in are playoff teams. We aren't in the playoffs," Barone said, "but we want them to come in with some pride and make teams have to beat us." Game notes  The Nets are 12-20 on the road overall. ...
