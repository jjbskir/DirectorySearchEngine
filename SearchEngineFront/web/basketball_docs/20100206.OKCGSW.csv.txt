OAKLAND, Calif. -- While  Kevin Durant  was lighting up the scoreboard in the second half,  Russell Westbrook  was chasing a quadruple-double. Although Westbrook settled for a double-double, he made things interesting. Durant scored 29 points, Westbrook added 21, and the  Oklahoma City Thunder  won their fifth straight, beating the  Golden State Warriors  104-95 Saturday night. "Everybody knows it's coming; he's been flirting with triple-doubles all season," Durant said. "A quadruple-double doesn't come around very often. He did a great job of initiating the offense, getting his steals and making easy baskets. We followed his lead tonight. He does a great job of filling up the stat sheet." Jeff Green  had 18 points for the Thunder, who matched their best winning streak this season. Westbrook added 10 assists, a career-high -- and the most in an NBA game this season -- eight steals and seven rebounds. "I just try to get into passing lanes," Westbrook said. "When you're playing, people throw the ball real lackadaisical. I was sitting there, waiting and waiting. They threw it and I'd go." Corey Maggette  scored 24 points to lead the Warriors, who have lost eight straight and are 3-8 in their last 11 home games.  Stephen Curry  had 24 points,  Anthony Tolliver  added 11 points and 11 rebounds,  Monta Ellis  had 15 and  Andris Biedrins  grabbed 18 rebounds. "We just didn't look like a team," Warriors coach Don Nelson said. "A lot of guys didn't play well at the same time." Durant and Green combined for 22 points in the third quarter, helping the Thunder score 36 in the period and open a 15-point lead entering the fourth. "Russell did a great job of controlling the pace of the game," Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  said. "Defensively we turned it up in the second half and got our hands in the air. Russell gets eight steals -- that's amazing. That doesn't happen very often." Oklahoma City eventually led by 19 points before the Warriors made a late run. "Sloppy turnovers and then the third quarter," Curry said. "We let them get a double-digit lead and we can't come back from that." There wasn't much to separate the two teams through the first half, with Westbrook hitting a driving layup with 1:33 remaining to give the Thunder a 52-50 advantage at the intermission. Durant scored 25 or more for the 24th consecutive game, the longest since  Allen Iverson  reached 27 in 2000-01. "I continue to be aggressive and open some stuff for my teammates," Durant said. "I did a better job of looking on the weak side and taking jumpers there. My teammates got me going in the second half." Durant, who needed to score 32 to take over the league scoring lead, started slow, and was limited to three points in the second quarter, all on free throws. He opened the game 1 of 5 and missed all four of his second-quarter shots. Game notes  Biedrins' 10 first-quarter rebounds were the most by a Warriors player in one period this season. ...
